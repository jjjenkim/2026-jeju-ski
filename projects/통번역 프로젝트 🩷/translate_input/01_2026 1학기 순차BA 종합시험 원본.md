H.E. Mr ZHANG Yunming, Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Mr CHEN Jie, Vice Mayor of Shanghai Municipal Government, Ambassador TAN Jian, Deputy Director-General, Ambassador Odette Melono, Distinguished participants, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the Government of the People’s Republic of China, represented here today by the Vice-Minister, for hosting this important workshop, and for your warm welcome and hospitality. I am very pleased to be in Shanghai once again after my visit last September. Shanghai has an old history and, at the same time, is now at the forefront of technological development. I wish to welcome all of the delegations from various parts of the world.

Your Excellency, Vice-Minister, your collaboration on this workshop comes at a critical time. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is already impacting every aspect of our daily activities. This is true for many scientific disciplines including the chemical sciences and the fields of disarmament and non-proliferation.

Ladies and Gentlemen, The Chemical Weapons Convention (the Convention), with its Organisation known as the OPCW, remains a central pillar of the international disarmament system. The Convention is the most widely adhered-to disarmament treaty. With 193 States Parties, 98% of the global population lives under its protection. Its overarching mission is the elimination of chemical weapons and the prevention of their re-emergence.

Every year, the OPCW conducts hundreds of industry inspections to promote a high level of safety in the chemical industry. Alongside this, the Secretariat provides comprehensive support to the Organisation’s Member States. We assist States Parties in implementing the Convention, and in ensuring that they have the capacity to meet their obligations. We also provide States Parties with assistance and protection against the use and threat of use of chemical weapons, and strengthen their capacity to respond to chemical incidents.

Over the past decade, despite our collective achievements, chemical weapons have been used in several countries. In the ongoing war in Ukraine, there are allegations of use of chemical weapons by both sides. In the Syrian Arab Republic, after more than a decade of work, and the destruction of 27 chemical weapons production facilities and 1,300 metric tonnes of chemical weapons stockpiles, the task is still unfinished because of the lack of cooperation under the Assad regime.

The Assad regime never declared a significant part of its chemical weapons programme and was unwilling to respond to the questions from the inspectors of the Organisation. Following the fall of the Assad Government last December (2024), there have been a number of positive developments, and the Syrian transitional authorities have assured me of their commitment to fully meeting the country’s obligations under the Convention. Our work is already well under way, and we have established a good level of cooperation and dialogue with the Syrian authorities.

A particular concern in Syria, and beyond, is the risk of chemical weapons falling into the hands of non-State actors. The threat of chemical terrorism remains ever present. ISIS has used chemical weapons in Iraq and in Syria. The Aum Shinrikyo sect (cult) perpetrated an attack in the Tokyo subway using the chemical agent sarin in 1995. Recently, an event organised by Japan and the United States was held at the Headquarters of the Organisation to better understand what happened on that day of 20 March 1995, when there were more than 640 victims as a result of the attack in Tokyo.

The conclusion was very clear: this could happen again anywhere in any city in any country, with much more serious consequences, using modern technologies (for instance those that disseminate chemicals by drones), which are nowadays at the disposal of many people. Emerging technologies such as synthetic biology, drones, and 3D printing, all lower the technological barriers that had previously prevented non-State actors such as terrorists from acquiring and using chemical weapons.

Artificial intelligence and quantum computing only accelerate these developments. Malicious actors may produce very dangerous chemicals in an easier, faster and cheaper way than before. Such chemicals could be made with specific properties that could evade detection and simplify delivery.

However, all of these new technologies also hold great potential for assisting us in our mission. AI, for instance, could be used by authorities to design new molecules of toxic chemicals and their synthetic pathways (routes), allowing for proactive response and countermeasures. AI also has the potential to facilitate property prediction and risk assessments, aiding our ability to detect and counteract the use of toxic chemicals.

In a broader sense, the continued application of AI in chemistry will greatly accelerate scientific and technological advancements for our common benefit. The challenge, therefore, is to optimise the opportunities, while recognising and mitigating any potential risks.

Ladies and Gentlemen, The OPCW has adopted a proactive approach to addressing the impact of AI on the implementation of the Convention. In April last year, I convened a two-day meeting of experts external to the Organisation (IBM, Google DeepMind, Accenture, University of Amsterdam, etc.) to explore the implications of AI on our work. This important event provided a forum to discuss and share experience in different and complementary areas of AI and its use in chemistry.

In June 2024, the German Federal Foreign Office organised a conference on “AI and weapons of mass destruction,” which provided another key platform for discussing AI and its impact on disarmament and arms control. I had the pleasure of delivering the keynote address at that conference, highlighting our ongoing efforts. Building on this momentum, from 22 to 24 October last year, the Kingdom of Morocco and the OPCW co-organised the first-ever Global Conference on the Role of AI in Advancing the Implementation of the Convention in Rabat, Morocco. The conference was unique, and it brought together over 190 stakeholders, with representatives from 46 States Parties and international organisations, as well as experts with a variety of backgrounds, from academia, and the chemical industry.

From these activities, and many others, we have now identified two key focus areas for our future work on artificial intelligence: First, the continued analysis and assessment of the risks and opportunities of AI in the implementation of the Convention. To this end, I established, a new Temporary Working Group (TWG) on AI consisting of 15 experts, which started its work in January this year. Second, the Secretariat is running an AI Research Challenge. In this project we are funding four teams to conduct research to find ways in which AI can be used to strengthen our capabilities. The tasks of the Temporary Working Group on AI as well as the AI Research Challenge will be completed by the end of this year, creating a solid foundation on which we can continue to build.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Today’s workshop is a direct continuation of the OPCW’s commitment to harnessing technology for enhanced chemical safety and security. It builds on recommendations and outcomes from our earlier efforts. As such, it is not only very timely, but also a vital initiative in maintaining momentum and producing tangible results. It is the first capacity-building programme that the OPCW Technical Secretariat has organised in regard to AI and chemical safety and security. Here in Shanghai, we will deepen our understanding of the potential practical uses of AI in strengthening chemical safety and security management in States Parties.

We will also explore potential risks related to the misuse of this transformational technology to cause harm. We are well placed to do so, given the number of leading experts in chemistry and chemical industry present here today, both from the host country and abroad. The workshop will showcase the use of AI in improving production and safety practices within the chemical industry. It will also highlight the potential risks associated with AI, such as the possibility of circumventing security measures in pursuit of malicious objectives. The workshop will develop recommendations for the OPCW and States Parties in advancing chemical safety and security using AI.I am confident that its outcomes will contribute to enabling States Parties to better engage in the discussions within the Organisation.

Dear Vice-Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, I hope that the conversations that will take place here will continue in other relevant international fora, in addition to our own activities. This will further enrich the global dialogue on AI and chemical safety and security. I encourage you all to make the best use of this valuable opportunity. Do not hesitate to engage actively in discussions during this workshop. Make the most of every opportunity to network during the breaks. And benefit as much as you can from the exchanges among all of you, AI experts.I wish you all a productive workshop and look forward to receiving the outcomes in due course. Thank you for your attention.

**2. UNFPA**

**Statement by Dr. Natalia Kanem Executive Director, UNFPA at the Annual Session of the Executive Board of UNDP, UNFPA and UNOPS**

Mr. President, Dear colleagues, dear friends, dear young people,

Peace is foremost in our minds and a constant concern for the women and young people UNFPA serves. Recently, I’ve reflected upon the tremendous unique work UNFPA does and the people with whom we have the responsibility to do it: The midwives who bring comfort and care to women when they and their newborns need it most. The frontline women’s organizations offering expert insight into the needs of their communities.

Mobile health teams braving treacherous conditions to bring life-saving services, family planning and prenatal care to women in the most remote communities. Religious and traditional leaders come to mind, joining us in advocating for girls’ education and against child marriage, and the boys and men who must be applauded for their defense of women and girls and their rights.

Teachers and parents open doors for UNFPA to assist adolescents on their journey into adulthood safely and in good health. And always, I think of my selfless UNFPA colleagues – some 6000 strong, working in more than 150 countries across the development-humanitarian-peace continuum. I consider the nearly one hundred Member States whose core contributions make that work possible, and I thank you for that.

Joint programming within the United Nations system is crucial to UNFPA’s achievements. Here, I must say a word of appreciation to UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner – an important partner and friend over our past eight years of common service as Under-Secretaries-General in New York.

And of course, my thoughts turn to you, esteemed members of the Executive Board. Your stewardship guided UNFPA to unprecedented success, even with the pushback, on occasion, against elements of our core mandate.

Over the past decade, with your all-important political and financial support, UNFPA made enormous progress for women and girls. We advanced their health, their rights, their bodily autonomy and their choices. Together, we achieved and made a difference in the lives of women and young people.

Today, we are a proud public health and population agency, a key partner in delivering essential services to women and girls in development and humanitarian circumstances, and in helping young people to promote peace.

Today, UNFPA is a stronger, more focused, more transparent agency than ever before. We are the only entity in the United Nations system entirely focused on reproductive health and rights across the life course – from the prenatal period to, hopefully, a healthy, happy old age, work that underpins so much progress against the Sustainable Development Goals, as evidenced in my annual report to the Board.

What does this look like in practice? It means that, with countries in the lead, contraceptives will reach the last mile, so that women and couples can decide freely whether or when to have children. UNFPA trains and deploys tens of thousands of midwives, so that even in the most hard-to-reach settings, women can deliver safely, and they and their newborns survive and thrive. We work with partners, community and civil society leaders and families so that girls get an education and avoid early marriage and female genital mutilation.

And under the aegis of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, UNFPA has succeeded in making the aspiration for peace in the home and the end of gender-based violence a priority. The scourge of gender-based violence must come out of the shadows – that’s the first step to ending it once and for all, including online and technology-facilitated gender-based violence – an area where UNFPA continues to play a leading role.

UNFPA is on the ground, prepositioning supplies and developing anticipatory action plans with governments and civil society – even before disaster strikes. Our collaboration with local and women-led organizations is an essential part of that equation, representing more than 40 percent of UNFPA’s humanitarian funding. Women are the experts, with an intimate understanding of the lives and needs of their families and communities.

Since 2015, UNFPA helped avert more than 350,000 maternal deaths. We prevented around 140 million unintended pregnancies and over 40 million unsafe abortions.

Since 2018, UNFPA delivered over 400 million couple-years of family planning protection through provision of hundreds of millions of condoms and numerous forms of modern contraception of a woman’s choice. The trust shown to UNFPA by programme countries and donors alike is remarkable. UNFPA being entirely voluntarily funded, it’s significant that we more than doubled our revenue over the past decade. That reflects confidence in our mission and our ability to deliver. The development marketplace is a competitive one, and it has spoken over and over again in favour of UNFPA – because of our results, as outlined in my annual report, because of our mandate, our sharp focus, our prioritization, our efficiency and our transparency.

By any metric – evaluations judging the satisfaction of the women and girls we serve, multilateral performance assessments, audits, or in terms of revenue – under the guidance of this Executive Board, UNFPA is a pronounced success story.

Partnership in action: UNFPA results show the power of global solidarity, a principle currently being tested like never before. Sexual and reproductive health and rights have many proud champions. Yet these rights continually come under siege in some quarters, with alarming rollbacks and funding cuts now threatening hard-won progress.

The gap between needs and resources is stark. Multilateralism is being questioned, and international humanitarian law flouted with impunity – all while crises, conflict and climate change push more and more women and girls to the brink. The women and girls UNFPA serves – those represented by the statistics I just mentioned – feel this deeply, personally. Though they may never know the names or faces of you in this room, or of decision-makers in your capitals, they feel the difference your support makes in their lives.

As they will certainly feel the impact, should diminished funding result in diminished ambition, or if reflexive decisions about change and structures fail to put women and girls at the heart of development, humanitarian and peace responses. If the United Nations doesn’t stand by the side of a ten-year-old girl in a least developed country or a pregnant woman fleeing conflict or crisis, who will? Yes, it’s the right thing to do. It’s also the best investment any country can make.

The central premise of the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development, the ICPD, is clear; its central promise is also clear: reproductive rights are human rights and a precondition for women’s empowerment, essential for the advancement of societies and the well-being and prosperity of all people.

Data and evidence repeatedly bear this out. When women and girls can access healthcare, they are more likely to finish school, join the workforce and raise healthier families.

The returns are ripples of hope that multiply across generations, leading to stronger economies, healthier populations, and more secure and resilient societies around the world. Our new UNFPA Strategic Plan 2026-2029, to be submitted for the Board’s approval at the Second Regular Session in August, reaffirms UNFPA’s critical ICPD mandate and, particularly, our normative role.

UNFPA proudly defends the rights of all people, especially anyone too often pushed aside or pushed behind – persons with disabilities, indigenous women, people in all their sexual diversities, people of African descent, those living under protracted crisis and young people, in a refugee or IDP camp, for example. As I arrive at the end of my eight-year tenure as UNFPA Executive Director, I count our support to truly leave no one behind among the highlights.

Today, UNFPA is a recognized leader in the fields of human reproduction; population data, census and statistics; logistics and delivery of reproductive commodities at scale; humanitarian response on sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender-based violence; and on youth leadership development, including youth, peace and security.

Today, no other United Nations agency combines operational and human rights work the way UNFPA does, with a clear focus on women and girls throughout the life course. In that vein, I request the support of this Board to ensure that the important work we’ve done collectively in recent years puts gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health prominently at the centre of every crisis response as the humanitarian reset goes forward. UNFPA is indispensable in the protection cluster leadership, and we intend to continue as a provider of last resort to end gender-based violence and help survivors find healing.

Going forward, the voices, expertise and leadership of local actors, especially women-led organizations, will be more important than ever in humanitarian delivery. Today, UNFPA delivers faster, and we reach farther than ever to deploy our expertise within hours of the onset of a crisis. Our approach is not just about speed. It hinges on delivering real impact and the life-saving services that women and girls tell us must be prioritized in every humanitarian response.

The new Strategic Plan, the development of which was skillfully led by our Deputy Executive Director, Programme, Diene Keita, keeps a focus on attainment of three transformative results – zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices – all of these efforts resting on a sound basis of population data and evidence.

Yet now, UNFPA also must adapt to a world of rapidly changing demographics. Hence, the introduction of a fourth strategic plan outcome: demographic change and population dynamics, which reflects countries’ increasing demand for UNFPA expertise in this space, notably on issues related to high fertility and also low fertility, population ageing and census support.

This is advice and support that UNFPA is uniquely equipped to provide. By harnessing data and evidence, we are helping governments to develop policies and programmes that build demographic resilience, while also upholding the personal rights and choices of women and girls. The private sector increasingly is joining us in this platform.

Turning now to the Integrated Budget that accompanies the Strategic Plan, I emphasize that for UNFPA it is not business as usual. Under the leadership of our Deputy Executive Director, Management, Andrew Saberton, UNFPA undertook scenario planning very early on, and we budgeted conservatively in anticipation of the current funding constraints. The steps we took proved protective for our programming. We successfully diversified funding via International Financial Institutions, philanthropy, the private sector and UN pooled funding. Gratifyingly, last year UNFPA saw record income of nearly US$1.7 billion US dollars, with a substantial part of that growth coming in for our humanitarian work.

With concern about potential further reductions, UNFPA is adjusting our high-level financial framework and will report back in the coming months.

UNFPA has extensive experience consulting with Member States and taking into account diverse views and interests. The positions of individual countries may change over time, yet a diversity of perspective and opinion is a normal and welcome part of elucidating our work on the Strategic Plan and its Integrated Budget. We strive to achieve balance. We count on your support in that effort, and related to this, allow me to repeat that operationalizing the Strategic Plan at the country level is firmly grounded in the concept of national ownership, as expressed in the Country Programme Documents.

In recent weeks I've listened keenly to Executive Board members from all five regional groups. UNFPA benefits enormously from such consultations, and having analyzed the feedback, we are fully confident that the direction articulated in the Strategic Plan is the right path at the right time to accelerate progress.

Therefore, we request and eagerly look forward to your approval of the Strategic Plan and Integrated Budget during the August session. I call upon the Executive Board to meet the moment we face with strong support for UNFPA’s work and to not get sidetracked. Regardless of terminology, the women and girls we serve deserve your support.

At the 1994 ICPD, Member States asserted that reproductive health and women’s empowerment are intertwined. Both are necessary for societies to advance. This holds true in development and humanitarian settings, and it holds true when women take their role in fashioning the peace.

Women and girls belong at the centre of development. They are never passive victims of conflict and disaster. They are leaders, change-makers, and the backbone of recovery, resilience and sustainable development. Women’s strength, courage and determination are central to stabilizing families and to creating lasting peace and security.

As is well known, in the past few months UNFPA and our partners experienced devastating funding cuts by a key donor. For UNFPA alone, this meant cancellation of more than 40 existing projects worth more than $330 million US dollars.

These cuts translate into cuts in essential services, which put millions of already vulnerable women and girls at even greater risk, depriving them of the health and protection services they rely on. Even before the funding cuts, humanitarian needs far outstripped the funding, which makes this loss even more catastrophic.

For example:

In Afghanistan, 21 women’s clinics already shut their doors, and another 18 are in limbo. More than 550 facilities will have to close by the end of 2025. And up in the mountains, it will mean women have no access to any health services.

In Jordan, since 2013 UNFPA’s safe delivery services in Za’atari Refugee Camp meant the successful delivery of more than 18,000 babies without a single maternal death. I am so sad to report that now the maternity ward is closed.

In Pakistan, UNFPA life-saving interventions manage the treatment of rape, prevent HIV and deliver basic emergency obstetric services and neonatal care. That has ceased in 65 health facilities.

In Somalia, 12 community clinics staffed by midwives have been forced to shutter, and training and deployment of additional midwives halted.

In Haiti, over a million people need gender-based violence assistance. Any eventual suspension of funding there will create significant gaps in staffing and programme continuity. The financial outlook becomes cloudier as other donors look to reduce aid. Therefore, UNFPA must anticipate reductions in both core and non-core resources this year.

However, as mentioned, we are taking proactive measures in our budget and revenue scenario planning. Nevertheless, already the impact is huge, especially in humanitarian settings. For this year, 2025, we urge you to strongly support the UNFPA humanitarian appeal, which calls for $1.4 billion US dollars to deliver irreplaceable reproductive health and GBV prevention and treatment services to more than 45 million women and young people across 57 countries.

We have analyzed the most neglected crises – and the list is long, including Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Mozambique, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Venezuela – where persistent funding gaps converge with already weakened health and protection services for women and girls.

UNFPA humanitarian response plans in these countries were under 30% funded in 2024. What this means on the ground is a shortage of midwives to support women in labour; the absence of medicine and equipment to take care of childbirth complications; shuttered safe spaces; and a lack of medical care, counselling and legal services for survivors of assault. The video you just viewed was produced as part of our “Lights Out” communications campaign. Please help UNFPA keep the lights on.

Mr. President, Excellencies,

I now turn to the UN80 initiative announced by the Secretary-General and in which my team and I have been extensively engaging with the Secretary-General’s office and other principals, both bilaterally and through the UN Sustainable Development Group and the Inter-agency Standing Committee for Humanitarian Affairs. As protective as UNFPA’s scenario planning has been, we are not complacent. We intend to be drivers of our own destiny and to continue our stellar track record of programme delivery and management efficiencies.

UNFPA is reviewing its business model. We are anticipating and responding to the evolving geopolitical and funding environment. The new Strategic Plan will assure that UNFPA delivers results effectively, efficiently, and at scale in every context. UNFPA is asking not only what we need to do, but also how we do it—so that our operations, presence, and systems adapt to the expressed needs of those we serve.

As you know, UNFPA has long been a leader on the efficiency agenda, currently co-chairing the Business Innovations Group. In making our organization more fit for purpose, we took difficult decisions. After more than two years of careful planning and consultation, more than a third of our headquarters decentralized – most recently with relocation of technical and programme staff and the Independent Evaluation Office to Nairobi. This follows transformations of our Humanitarian Response Division, now based in Geneva, and our Copenhagen-based supply chain management operations.

UNFPA also leads when it comes to outsourcing. As part of UN80, we are volunteering to outsource all our back-office operations to other entities so that we remain laser-focused on what we do best and on our mandate.

I have already outlined how the ICPD is UNFPA’s North Star and how, as a public health and population agency, what we deliver is unique. Now, UN80 offers a generational opportunity to realign the UN system around a coherent, accountable, measurable and transformative platform.

The UNFPA mandate is central to the entire sustainable development agenda. It must be protected and promoted, and we very much count on the Board’s support in that regard.

Let’s not sacrifice human rights and reproductive rights in the name of expediency or efficiency. UNFPA speaks frankly and intelligently about culturally sensitive issues, always factoring in the context, and always rigorously upholding free choice in reproductive matters, and assuring there is informed consent without coercion of any kind.

As always, UNFPA stands ready to listen, we are alert to opportunities and amenable to compromise, understanding that it is our values that underpin our success: mission clear; methods flexible.

What is important is that UNFPA technical expertise and presence on the ground be protected, so we continue to respond to country expectations. To decisively end maternal mortality, for example, programme countries depend on UNFPA’s support more than ever, and our capacity-building assures that development is indeed country-led – especially as population structures are changing dynamically.

Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,

Across all facets of UNFPA programmes and operations in all settings, my senior management team and I remain unwavering in our commitment to upholding the highest standards of accountability and transparency. We welcome the annual reports of the Office of Audit and Investigation Services (OAIS), the Independent Evaluation Office, the Ethics Office and the Oversight Advisory Committee.

We are also pleased to present the new UNFPA accountability framework, which brings together internal controls, risk management, ethics, protection from sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment, financial management and oversight.

UNFPA values the constructive guidance provided by OAIS and the other oversight bodies, and we work closely with them to address areas of concern. In upholding zero-tolerance for all forms of wrongdoing, we continually strengthen measures for protection from sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, including through a dedicated unit.

I commend the Independent Ethics Office for its nurturance of a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability, which enhances the trust in and credibility of UNFPA, both internally and externally.

I also commend the Independent Evaluation Office. Evidence-based decision-making and organizational learning are vital for accelerating progress on UNFPA’s transformative results.

For the past eight years, Director Marco Segone has been the face of evaluation at UNFPA. We arrived together, and I have appreciated his skill, dedication, his support for young evaluators and his work to strengthen evaluation across the UN system, including as Chair of the UN Evaluation Group. This is Marco’s last Executive Board session with UNPFA, and we wish him well in his retirement and future endeavours.

Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,

As you’ve heard, today also marks my final address to the Executive Board. It brings to mind UNFPA’s indebtedness to my predecessor, the late Professor Babatunde Osotimehin, and every one of our highly distinguished former Executive Directors. The collaborative spirit that has defined our work together during my two terms as Executive Director has been tremendous. I especially thank you, Mr. President, Ambassador Andrés Efrén Montalvo Sosa, and all the Board presidents of my tenure, starting with Ambassador Ib Petersen. Your impeccable stewardship is part of the success narrative of UNFPA. I also sincerely thank every Bureau member, past and present, for your kind attention to UNFPA.

And I reserve a heartfelt, profound thanks to my wonderful UNFPA colleagues across the globe. Your work in every country office and on the humanitarian frontlines showcases the trademark skill, passion and integrity that define the UNFPA staff.

Thank you for keeping your eye on the well-being of that precious 10-year-old girl moving through her adolescence. She inspires us every day. I also appreciate our civil society partners, as well as our academic, philanthropic and private sector associates and the women-led groups with whom we share resources and a firm commitment to advancing rights and choices.

What an honour it has been to lead UNFPA, an organization primed for even greater heights! I leave with so much faith in the United Nations, in UNFPA and the important work that this agency does. And I have every confidence that the organization I leave behind will become even stronger, ever more resilient and more nimble.

You should know that when I talk with women and girls who have suffered unspeakable violence and trauma, they tell me they have been bolstered by UNFPA’s safe spaces and our dignity kits. Our psychosocial support and health services are helping them to overcome mistreatment and to look forward with hope in their hearts.

I have also met women in their time of tremendous joy, welcoming a wide-eyed healthy newborn into the world. I will never forget women like Mariel, a young mother from a typhoon-ravaged community in the Philippines, who gave birth in a UNFPA mobile facility, which was basically a great big truck. Mom was all smiles introducing me to her baby girl born on Valentine’s Day. Her chosen name: “Heart Eunne Fae” in honour of UNFPA!

In communities where child marriage and early childbearing are the norm, with UNFPA’s help girls are defying the odds, claiming their right to stay in school and inspiring other girls to pursue their dreams.

A 13-year-old girl I met at a UNFPA one-stop centre in Chad – a safe space offering medical, psychosocial and legal services for survivors of sexual violence – was another unforgettable encounter. Despite the horrific trauma she endured, her eyes lit up when she told me her dream: to go back to school.

I recall women weeping at a refugee centre in Moldova. They fled their homes in Ukraine with their children and whatever they could carry in a backpack or sack, leaving husbands and other loved ones to an uncertain fate.

And displaced women and children in Somalia, who had walked for days and weeks across a parched landscape in search of food, water and safety.

The harrowing stories of hunger, hardship and harm make abundantly clear why it is so important that UNFPA be present; that the rights of women and girls to health, safety and dignity be prioritized.

Contraception, sexual and reproductive health care, protection from gender-based violence – these are not luxuries. While sometimes debated in these august halls, let us make no mistake: these are essential services that women and girls everywhere need and that are their right. Even when there are opposing positions, let us agree that much more unites than divides us. As language is debated, let us unfailingly uphold the fundamental values that must never be compromised.

What better way to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the UN Charter than for “we the peoples” to “reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women”.

Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Executive Board,

As Member States navigate the next chapter of reform, I appeal to you to safeguard that which matters. By every metric we have kept over the past eight years and discussed with you, the communities we work with matter. UNFPA matters. The work we do saves and changes lives. It is valued. It is effective and efficient. It is irreplaceable.

I am immensely proud of our teams around the world and the way they continue to deliver, whatever the challenges. Because somewhere there’s a 10-year-old girl happily playing in her island home. She’s on the cusp of adolescence, and thanks to UNFPA, she will be well prepared to navigate that adolescence with great anticipation, and without fear.

Somewhere else, there’s a woman with no choice but to flee. She’s running in panic, gathering children and baggage. UNFPA must be there to receive her, to represent her needs. She’s not asking for favours. She just wants to give birth safely, maintain her dignity, and exercise her reproductive rights. She wants help to undo damage that never should have been inflicted in the first place.

And UNFPA will accompany her into the light where she can live the life she deserves, replete with power and beauty. Mr. President, Members of the Executive Board, That’s her right. And that’s our promise. That’s the ICPD vision for which UNFPA is custodian. Together, let’s make it real for every girl, every woman, every young person. Together, let’s build that brighter future of rights and choices – for everyone. We know it can be done, because with you UNFPA has shown that it can and will be done. Thank you.

**Speech by the Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, "Meeting Challenges through Dialogue: Towards Cooperation, Prosperity and Progress“ 8 June2023**

Mister President, Heads of State and Government, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I would like to start by thanking Kazakhstan and its President for opening this Astana Forum to issues above and beyond economic cooperation. Because international cooperation and the sustainable financing of public goods such as culture, science and education are absolutely essential to shape our common future but also to shape just and sustainable economies and societies. This is precisely the mandate of UNESCO.

This morning, I would like to present two examples of concrete multilateralism, especially relevant to the region. The first one was mentioned by many of you this morning. It is science, scientific diplomacy and cooperation on a crucial issue: water. Here, in Central Asia, water means aquifers, trans-boundary water resources, and especially glaciers. Glaciers are essential water towers for the region. President Tokayev reminded us of the tragedy going on right now.

In this region, glaciers have shrunk by 30% over the past 50 years, due to climate disruption. What is happening here in Central Asia is also happening everywhere in the world. Last September, ahead of COP 27, a UNESCO study showed that one-third of all glaciers in World Heritage sites will disappear by 2050.

This challenge is, by nature, a global and regional challenge, as water is very often a trans-boundary issue. As such, it is an issue that requires cooperation. So what has UNESCO done with the countries of the region, in Central Asia, to address this issue? First, together with four States of the region, we worked since 2021 to better understand and prepare for the risks associated with the sudden and deadly overflow of high mountain lakes, due to the melting of glaciers.

This is vital scientific cooperation that allows governments and civil societies to be scientifically informed and to make the right decisions. To quote the great Kazakh poet Abai, “Ignorance is lack of knowledge, in the absence of which nothing can be achieved”. So we have to start with scientific cooperation. By 2025, we aim to map glaciers, snow and glacial lakes across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The second pillar is assessing risk.

Together with all the countries involved, we assess the vulnerabilities of at-risk communities. And our third pillar is precisely to develop early warning systems that are necessary to protect the populations that are directly at risk. And second, as part of this scientific cooperation, we will work at the multilateral level of UNESCO but also at the regional level,

I am happy to announce that we are launching a major project with the five countries of the region funded by the Global Environment Facility, to develop for the first time a regional overview of the whole cryosphere, glaciers, but also permafrost and snow resources. As this example shows, working at the regional and multilateral levels is both relevant, because of the nature of the issue, and essential, if we are to serve the general interests of the population. For we also know that when nature collapses, so too do all the cultures that depend on it.

And what better place to measure that risk than here in Central Asia –a region with deep historical culture? Whether that means the nomadic cultures or the cultural traditions linked to the mountains, or the beautiful history of the Silk Roads with their exceptional diversity. The second example I would like to discuss this morning has also been mentioned by a few of you. It’s the technological challenge. It concerns the exponential development of artificial intelligence in particular. This is an evolution which concerns everyone.

In recent weeks, we have seen the dazzling progress of generative AI software such as ChatGPT. Developments that have left us astounded –but also uneasy. Because when it comes such rapid technological development, we must be clear-sighted. We must balance their promise –as great as it seems to be –against their potential pitfalls. We must ensure that these innovations align with our values: protection of our data, of our privacy. Protection against gender bias, against the rise in misinformation.

We need to be able to trust these new technologies if we are to build digital economies. And, if we want to have trust and confidence, we need ethical frameworks. Further, we need ethical frameworks at the global level, because having a fragmented ethical framework means having no ethical framework at all. Indeed, this is a competitive field, so we need to all share the same ethical framework.

This is what UNESCO did with its 193 Member States. We embarked on this journey in 2019 and I am very happy that in 2021 our Member States voted, by consensus –consensus which is still desirable and possible –to adopt the first global ethical framework for the development of artificial intelligence. These are just two examples linked to UNESCO’s mandate where I believe we see the importance of dialogue, of course, of multilateral cooperation. As President Tokayev said, for some issues, this is not only a desirable path but the only path. I think that there is no better place than in Central Asia, a region that stands at so many crossroads, to discuss this with you. I thank you for your attention. Thank you.

**Video address by Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, on the occasion of the conference “Inequidad y Diversidad en el Mundo de la Post pandemia” Universidad Nacionalde Tres de Febrero. 17 June 2020**

I would like to first thank the University Tres de Febrero. I am honoured to join you today. I thank its Rector, my friend Aníbal Jozami, for organizing this conversation, one in a series of timely debates that help us think ahead in these extremely difficult times. After Europe, Latin America seems to hav ebecome the epicentre of the pandemic, with the peak still some weeks away for some of your neighbours. But defeating the pandemic, once we have done so at the global level, will be a hollow victory if we do not learn anything from it. This crisis is a societal event, and an opportunity to challenge our concepts and our certainties – to open our eyes to things we don’t usually see.

The philosopher Hannah Arendt said that a crisis only becomes a disaster when we respond to it with preformed concepts and ideas. And this particular crisisis an unforgiving mirror which, in the words of Senegalese philosopher Souleymane Bachir Diagne, has revealed “all that is scandalous about our world”. These scandals include the inequalities that divide the globe and compromise our future. These inequalities existed before COVID-19, of course, but they have been exacerbated and amplified by the pandemic.

Today’s health crisis risks becoming a major social and economic crisis tomorrow. This economic crisis is already taking shape on the horizon. According to UN statistics, half a billion people could fall intopovertyin the near future. For the first time in its history, the human development index could decline.We will not be equal in the face of this regression. The most vulnerable among us will be the most affected, in the same way as they were the most exposed to the virus. Indeed, according to the International Labour Organization, women are more likely to be affected by the impendingeconomic crisis. This also applies to young people, who will be looking to enter a severely weakened labour market.

The issue of inequalities is therefore fundamental–because while this is a health crisis first and foremost, its impacts will have a much wider and more enduring scope. UNESCO is an ideal forum to take action against the root causes of these inequalities, because the virus has affected all of the areas covered by our mandate. Indeed, in the fields of education, gender equality, access to information, open science and culture, the current context has revealed deep divides, which raise questions for our long-term objectives.

The first inequality that this crisis has revealed is our unequal exposure to illness. It is absolutely untrue that we are all equal before the virus. Immune defences vary widely from populationto population. Indigenous people, who have already paid a heavy price in the past, are once again especially vulnerable. In the absence of earlier and stricter lock down measures, these people need more protection. Social factors also play a key role, as underlined by the Indian journalist and author Rana Ayyub, who said that “social distancing is a curious privilege” for those living in the slums of Mumbai.

Similarly, key protective measures such as hand-washing are a problem for the two billion people around the world affected by hydric stress –one third of whom are in Africa. This was one of the messages of the World Water Development Report, which UNESCO published during the crisis on behalf of the UN-Water family. This is why, on this front for example, UNESCO has worked to reinforce water education programmes. It is also difficult to protect against COVID-19 when we are more exposed to the virus. This is especially true for women, who are on the frontline in fighting the disease.

According to the United Nations Population Fund, they represent 70% of healthcare and social workers around the world. It is also difficult to fight the virus without access to a high-quality health system or health insurance. This is the situation faced by almost half of the global population, according to two reports by the International Labour Organization. This is all the more important since the crisis is long, and ongoing. The second type of inequality that this crisis has revealed is its unequal impact, over and above unequal exposure to the virus itself.

This is especially visible in the education divide, which is closely linked tothe digital divide. According to UNESCO data, half of the 1.9 billion young people unable to attend school at the peak of the crisis do not have access to a computer at home. Forty-three per cent lack an Internet connection. This is also true in rural areas, in indigenous communities and also in sub-Saharan Africa, where 82% of learners do not have web access. In South America and the Caribbean, 40% of the region’s 123 million learners lack Internet access at home.

Nevertheless, most initiatives that governments have taken to ensure the continuity of learning depend on digital technologies. For most of these children, this means their education will be interrupted as long as school closures last, for lack of alternatives. Today, our latest figures show that over 1 billion learners are still affected by school closures, 62.3% of total enrolled learners. However, access to digital technologies is not enough –knowing how to use them is just asimportant.

Here also inequalities are common, especially due to gender. According toour 2019 report, I’d Blush If I Could, women are four times less likely than men to master these digital skills. In this context, dropout rates are inevitably worse among students already experiencing the most difficulties. Fragile populations are also most affected by school closures, because schools are not just places of learning –they are also places where children can receive affordable food, protection and social support.

We have seen everywhere the difficulties that arise when children lose access to affordable meals –the increased economic burden on families, the impact on poverty and the demand for social support. We have also learnt from the past that, when schools close, there is a greater risk of violence and physical and sexual abuse, especially for girls. This was clear during the Ebola pandemic, when many girls did not return to schools when they reopened.

We do not want to lose millions of secondary-aged girls after this crisis.In this exceptional situation, we urgently needed to take action, to avoid compromising our goal of quality education for all by 2030. This is why UNESCO launched a Global Education Coalition in March. This Coalition now has more than 130 partners from across the board –from the public and private sectors, the telecommunications industry, the mediaand the education community.

Our first action was to support wider Internet access by mobilizing major telecommunications players, including Orange, Vodafone and Telefónica. These companies provided free accessto educational content, in countries such as Burkina Faso, Liberia, Mali, Madagascar and Senegal. In Latin America and the Caribbean, an agreement has just been reached between UNESCO and Telefónica, for unrestricted use of its digital educational platform MiriadaX. Open-access classes will be offered free of charge throughout the region, with the goal of leaving no-one behind. However, digital technologies cannot be our only solutions for distance learning. This is why we have also supported the development of distance learning classes using more traditional –and accessible –media, including radio and television, especially community channels.

For example, we have trained teachers in Cameroon, so they are ableto give classes by radio or television. But even if the entire global population could access and use the Internet, tomorrow’s education would be meaningless without schools or teachers. Because learning is not about coding or techniques, it is about interactions and emotions –which depend on regular, face-to-face contact.For this reason, we are working to ensure that schoolsreopenas quickly as possible. To do so, we have published a practical guide for all Member States, with support from UNICEF, the World Bank and the World Food Programme.

Dear friends, As classrooms closed around the world, sotoodid museums, concert halls and theatres, revealing inequalities in a third field –culture.While many venues closed physically, others opened online. Once again, digital technology picked up the slack, ensuring and adding a new dimension to the continuity of culture. Of course, thistechnology maybe a temporary fallbackfor much of the cultural sector, and even offer new opportunities to reinvent and explore other paths, methods and media.

Indeed, UNESCO took part inthis impressive creative movement, by inviting people to visit World Heritage sites from home, and by giving people the chance to browse the resources of the open-access World Digital Library. But, once again, digital technology cannot be the only option, and cultural life cannot only take place online. If it did, it would be poorer, and it would only reachthe half of the world that is connected.

This risks creating serious economic damage, and isa major threat to theworld’sdiversity and complexity. This risk is not a new one: economic crises –like the one looming on the horizon –often result in more concentration and standardization. In the cultural field, these phenomena are dangerous. Firstly, because they representa risk to all cultural professionals. As figures from the International Labour Organization show, those working in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors account for 5.4% of global employment. Even in normal conditions their jobs are precarious by nature. But it is not just a question of economics. By threatening the people who keep culture alive, this crisis threatens the diversity of cultural expressions. Events that have taken place since time immemorial have already been interrupted. In Japan, the Gion Festival, which has taken place in Kyoto since the ninth century, has been cancelled. In Zambia, the Kuomboka ceremony, which marks the end of the rainy season, could not be held.

Around the world, major events like the Cannes Film Festival have been cancelled or postponed, along with thousands of smaller events. This has led to financial difficulties, uncertain employment and artistic losses on an unprecedented scale. UNESCO, with support from its network of experts and field offices, launched a major survey to study the impact of these cancellations onliving heritage, and on the communities that live through and for it.

With more than 150 testimonies, including 40 from South America and the Caribbean, this survey will help us better protect our living heritage, by preserving its wealth and longevity.Because, in the long term, these inequalities in cultural expression will lead to a real risk of depletion, that can only be countered by pro-active and ambitious decision-making, in terms of public support and more sources of financing for the cultural sector, including from the digital world.

We have also seen the increasing weightof fake news and misinformation, when access to accurate information can be a question of life and death during a crisis like this one. An unprecedented “infodemic” has recently gained ground.Using a wide range of media –television, radio, Internet and the printed press –UNESCO has fully supported efforts to fight misinformation. One way we did this was through the campaign “Facts”, which was relayed by major newspapers across the world, including La Nación in Argentina.

We have also launched a major radio and social media campaign on the African continent, working with artists, singers and musicians to counter misinformation. I know the emphasis that the governments of Argentina and Uruguay put on this subject, and they can count on our full cooperation. In closing, I would like to mention another issue raised by the virus very early on: the ethical risk. Very quickly, certain groups and communities were targeted on the pretext of illness. Like other historical pandemics, this crisis resulted in yet another race to find a scapegoat –a race towards discrimination. According to Human Rights Watch, in a few short weeks, xenophobia and racism towards people of Asian origins soared.

As infections increased, the targets of this discrimination changed, but the underlying messagestayed the same: certain minorities orprofessions wereaccused of spreading the virus.There is something concerning aboutthe speed atwhichthe very foundation of equality wasundermined. To measure and understand this rise in racism and discrimination, UNESCO undertook a series of research projects, in coordination with some of our UNESCOChairs, including Harvard.

Unfortunately, this ethical risk does not just concern racism and stigmatization. The virus, and the fears it has raised, have shown the fragility of ourethical frameworks, and how they are tested when we need security and protection in times of uncertainty and complexity. Especially when the new benefits of big data and AI are put on the table. It is at times like these that we most need guidance.

This guidance has been provided by UNESCO’s International Bioethics Committee and World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology, which issued a strong reminder of our fundamental freedoms and values. Similarly, ethical debates raised by contact tracing applications have made us even more determined to move forward on the first-ever global Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. This text is now being draftedat UNESCO, despite COVID-19, and will be presented to our 193 Member States in 2021. Ladies and gentlemen, Bachir Diagne was right when he said that this crisis had highlighted all that was scandalous about our world, inall fields.It is now up to us to act on this observation –because nothing in this situation is inevitable, but much is intolerable.

**MAKING TOURISM STRONGER AND READY FOR THE FUTURE**

**ALL REGIONS 27 DEC 2021 Zurab Pololikashvili Secretary-General**

This has been another challenging year for our societies, our economies and tourism. Many millions of jobs and businesses remain in peril, at the mercy of an evolving crisis and of the actions of governments. .

However, we are by no means in the same place we were when the pandemic was declared in March 2020. In fact, we have succeeded in 1. laying the foundations to restart tourism around the pillars of sustainability, innovation, and people and 2. investing for a resilient future.

Over the past year, much progress has been made in rolling out vaccinations and in both detecting and treating COVID-19. We have also seen significant progress made in finding the right balance between keeping people safe and keeping the vital lifeline of tourism intact, as illustrated by UNWTO’s effective collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) since the very start of the pandemic.

A collaborative and multilateral approach is and must remain at the centre of capitalizing on the lessons we have learned in such a short space of time. Ensuring harmonized travel protocols has been our message since day one. They are at the heart of tourism’s restart in many parts of the world, most notably in the Northern Hemisphere destinations during the peak summer months.

We are also encouraged by the resilience and determination coming from the tourism sector itself, as well as from our Member States. Like never before, the pandemic has made clear tourism’s relevance to our economies and societies. Tourism is now part of the global conversation and at the heart of both national and international recovery action plans.

Interest in UNWTO’s innovation and start-up competitions keeps growing, showcasing the talent we have unleashed, and our shared readiness to hear new voices and embrace new ideas.

Our global innovation ecosystem is now made up of more than 12,000 start-ups from 160 countries, with US$83 million mobilized and 300 corporate partners currently working on new tourism technologies.

And UNWTO’s education programmes are reaching unprecedented numbers of people, welcoming more than 20,000 students from 100 countries in just 18 months. We promote lifelong learning thanks to partnerships with the world’s top five institutions in tourism and hospitality.

Restarting tourism is unthinkable without green investments. We are collaborating with institutions such as the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank. To date, more than 200 investors are part of UNWTO’s global investment network/ advancing critical work such as supporting hotel chains from 50 countries to become more sustainable.

Tourism is ready to do the hard work and live up to its responsibilities to people and planet, as demonstrated by the huge interest we have received in the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism, launched at the UN Climate Summit COP26.

We are receiving a growing number of commitments to halve emissions by 2030 and to reach NetZero by 2050 at the latest, with Member countries, individual destinations, global companies and local players as well as media outlets, hundreds are on board, and counting.

And for people, we are making sure the benefits tourism offers are enjoyed as widely and fairly as possible. That includes establishing the sector as a driver of rural development, as celebrated through the Best Tourism Villages by UNWTO initiative. Launched to great enthusiasm this year, 44 villages from 32 countries were granted the recognition during our recent General Assembly, for showing a commitment to tourism development in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.

The 24th UNWTO General Assembly in Madrid brought our Members together to speak with one voice. Members commended UNWTO’s work done during the pandemic and its vision for the future of both the Organization and the sector, This landmark is designed to restore trust in travel, a vital ingredient for recovery. I am very grateful for the wide support of our Members, who have put their trust in me to serve a second term as UNWTO Secretary-General.

In a crisis, you realize both what’s important and who your friends are. And support for UNWTO has never been louder or more visible. Over the past 12 months, we have strengthened our key partnerships, among them the G20 and G7. We have further strengthened our voice at the top of the United Nations, including the landmark recognition of tourism and UNWTO by the UN Secretary-General.

UNWTO has made a significant leap to be on the ground next to our Members. This year we opened the first Regional Office for the Middle East in Riyadh, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Built and opened in record time, it will serve as the platform to deliver our commitment to education and as a global centre for tourism and rural development.

Moving closer to our Members in other regions is an ongoing task and we will also work towards opening the first regional offices in Africa and the Americas.

As we advance preparations for these new hubs, we also welcome new Member States. Antigua and Barbuda, a destination where tourism is an economic pillar, has joined UNWTO.

This shows that tourism-dependent countries look to UNWTO and depend on us, and we are ready to live up to this responsibility. Alongside this our network of Affiliate Members of the private sector, local administrations, destinations and academia, keeps growing.

So too does our collaboration with media outlets through new partnerships with Euronews, Xinhua and Travel Index, which build on our existing relationship with CNN International. As a result, the message of tourism for development will continue reaching a global audience of unprecedented size and diversity.

The way in which the pandemic has developed over the closing weeks of the year gives us all reason for concern and to again put public health above everything else.

But recent developments again validate our initial position: the only way forward is through collaboration and actions that are based on evidence rather than on speculation or political strategy.

UNWTO is in a good place to use the achievements of 2021 as a springboard for building a better tourism in the years to come, with the sector ready to return once conditions are right.

It is in this spirit that I wish everybody a safe and healthy 2022. UNWTO stands by your side, to keep on working together for our joint progress.

**Remarks by President Trump at the White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Leave Issued**

The President: Thank you. What a nice group. Thank you very much. Hi, everybody. Hi. Well, thank you very much. And I had a very busy time and a very busy day, and my daughter said, "You will be here." So—[laughter]—that was the end of that busy day, right? When a daughter says, "You have to be here." But she's done such an incredible job.

So I want to thank Ivanka. And from the very beginning—that's true. [Applause] Yes. From the very beginning, it's been an extraordinary—she has been so extraordinary, in terms of her advocacy for America's working families. Fourteen million people she's gotten jobs for, where she'd go into Walmart, she'd go into our great companies and say, "They really want help. They really want you to teach them," because the government can't teach like the companies can teach. And companies would take a half a million people, a million people.

And her goal when she started it 2 years ago was 500,000 jobs; she's done over 14 million. So that's really something. And that's on top of everything else, including what we're here for today.

I want to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for being here, and to the White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Family Leave, a subject that's a very big subject nowadays. We're pleased to be joined by Secretary Alex Azar. Alex, thank you very much. And thanks as well to Governor Phil Bryant, my friend for a long time. And we have—thank you, Phil. And we really—we have developed a fantastic relationship over the years. And it's been incredible. And what a job he does.

And I don't know, I have a feeling he's leaving office, not because he had to—he was leading everybody in the polls in that great State where we just had a tremendous victory, in Mississippi. But he was leading by a lot. I'd say, "Phil, why don't you run again?" "No, I think we're going to take it a little easy." See? He has a lot of confidence in himself. [Laughter] Nonconfident people would say: "I've got to run. I've got to run." But, Phil, you've done a fantastic job, and we appreciate it. And Mayor Betsy Price. Mayor, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.

We're also grateful to be—and have with us Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. And many of them participated today. I saw a list of who's who in Congress. And we appreciate it very much. They've—many of them have spoken.

We're here today to support the heroic calling for working moms and dads—to really help them. We're going to help them. And we're going to help them a lot. American families are the heart, soul, and backbone of our Nation. Strong and loving families build up our neighborhoods, sustain our communities, invigorate our cities, pass down our values, and make a brighter future for every citizen.

In the Trump economy, which is setting records every day—in fact, the stock market is up very substantially today, as some of you may know. And when it goes up, I think of 401(k)s. I used to think about stock. [Laughter] Now I think about 401(k)s, and I think about jobs. But it's up tremendously today.

In the Trump economy, American families are thriving like never before. Just last week, we announced that we smashed expectations and created 266,000 jobs in November, a number that was unthinkable a day before. A day before, they were guessing: "Would it be 80? Would it be 90? Would it be 160?" Somebody said, an optimist. And this was 266,000, plus you can add from the previous months, because we're adding some of the jobs they miscalculated on our side, as opposed to the opposite side—the positive way. So 266—almost 300,000 jobs—in November, which is an incredible number.

Seven million jobs have been added since election day. And I have to say, other nations are not doing well. Other parts of the world are not doing well at all. You look at Europe, you look at Asia, look at a lot of different places. We won't talk about China, because we're working a deal with China, but I wouldn't say, up until now, they've loved me. [Laughter]

Unemployment is at a 50-year low. And the African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. So the lowest level ever recorded—the history of our country.

And by the way, for women, the lowest in 71 years, but soon, it will be historic also. So I have to apologize for the 71 years. That's probably my worst statistic. Best in 71 years. I say, "Can you imagine?" Normally that would have been a great statistic for us, Phil. But nowadays we're a little spoiled, right?

But we've lifted nearly 1.4 million American children out of poverty. And this year, 40 million American families will benefit from the Republican child tax credit, each receiving an average of over $2,200 dollars. That's something. And that's—let's put the word "Republican" again. Let's emphasize it, because I notice, every time we do something, the Democrats try and say: "Well, we really did it, you know. We did." They didn't do it, but we'll be very nice. We want to be bipartisan.

In everything we do, we're putting the American families first. And frankly, we're putting America first. But American families are coming first. With more women working today than ever before, we now have a historic opportunity to enact long-overdue reforms. It's time to pass paid family leave and expand access to quality.

So we're going to have really an expanded access to quality, affordable childcare, in addition, for all American parents. And that's something that could take a long time before it ever got done, but we're going to get it done, and we're working with a lot of tremendous people, many of whom are in the room. And I want to thank you for that.

An estimated one out of every four American moms returns to work within 2 weeks of giving birth because they cannot afford to miss a paycheck or risk losing their job. We want every mother to have the chance to spend those precious few weeks with her newborn or adopted child. And I understand, statistically—they show, statistically, it's so much better for the baby in growing up, even in later years. I can imagine that.

And, Martha, I want to thank you for being here. I just see you. Martha McSally, everybody—Senator. That's very nice. Thank you.

And I'll tell you—would you please stand up? [Laughter] All of you. It's so great. So great. Thank you. Thank you. Congresswomen have done a fantastic job. Thank you.

That's why it's my state—and in my State of the Union Address, I called for Congress to pass paid family leave into law. And it was very well received, I have to say. One week ago, we were thrilled that Members of Congress introduced bipartisan—really, a very strong bipartisan legislation—paid family leave legislation. And that's what it's called.

We did criminal justice reform and we called it by a slightly different name. A lot of people don't know that it's criminal justice reform. I said, "Change the name." But somebody put it with the name. It's the First Step Act, which is good, but it's criminal justice reform. And in this case, we're going to just go with a very perfect name: paid family leave legislation. Jackie, is that good? Yes? I think, Jackie, we'll do it for you, okay? There's something about using a name that sort of—you don't have to think too much, right? [Laughter]

This week, my administration reached a historic deal with Congress: The Federal Government will now give 12 weeks of paid family leave to all Federal employees, something that nobody expected. And as a candidate for President, I pledged to advance paid family leave. With this important step, we are delivering. And we are really delivering like nobody has, I think, ever delivered before—if you look back, certainly within the first 3 years of a Presidency. And we're still short of the third year. We're, you know, getting close. Hard to believe we're getting close. January 20, we'll be there. But in less than 3 years, we've done things—and I always say that I fulfilled more promises than I made, which is the first for a politician. For a politician, that's a first, Martha.

My administration is also focused on expanding access to high-quality, affordable childcare. Last year, I was proud to sign into law the largest ever increase in Child Care Development Block Grants to States. The States understand that very well. A lot of Governors come up to me and they thank me for that.

In more than 60 percent of American homes, both parents work. Yet many struggle to afford childcare, which often costs more than $10,000 per year. And it's devastating to families, frankly. Devastating. Here with us today is Tseyon Mamo, who has benefited from childcare assistance and is now earning her degree in early childhood education while raising her two young, beautiful children. Tseyon, would you come up, please, and say a few words? Tseyon. Please. Nice to see you. Please.

**Prepared Remarks by Secretary DeVos at the unveiling of the Education Freedom Scholarships proposal**

Thank you, Walter Blanks, for that kind introduction. And thanks for sharing your story with us this morning. Stories like yours and Denisha Merriweather's touch my heart every time I hear them, and they keep me motivated every day. I know each of you has an inspiring story, too!

You are growing up in a place and Walter and Denisha were fortunate to live in places that offer more education opportunities for students and their families. So many other students across our country aren't so lucky.

A great education shouldn't be determined by luck or by address or by family income. And education shouldn't be an old-school, one-size-fits-all approach.

Every student is unique and every one learns differently. The freedom to do that is why I took this job. And it's why we're here this morning.

Because what's missing in education today is at the core of what makes America truly great: freedom.

Kids should be free to learn where and how it works for them.

The American people elected President Donald Trump in part because he pledged to bring school choice to America's students. "If we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars," he said, "then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America."

So, this Administration is excited to join with Congressman Bradley Byrne and Senator Ted Cruz in advancing a historic investment in America's students: the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act.

Education Freedom Scholarships will give hundreds of thousands of students across the country the power to find the right fit for their education.

Our bold proposal will offer a dollar-for-dollar Federal income tax credit for contributions to 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations that provide scholarships to students.

And the biggest winners will be America's forgotten children who will finally have choices previously available only for the rich, the powerful, and the well-connected.

All students need to be freed to pursue the education that will unlock their potential and unleash their creativity so they—and our country—can achieve unlimited success.

The key element of the proposal is freedom. Freedom for everyone involved. Students, families, teachers, schools, states can choose to participate in the program. Or they can elect not to participate. That's what freedom is all about.

Let me be clear: I firmly believe every state should embrace education freedom. But those are decisions families and communities must make. This is not another mandate.

We know gaining this freedom will require more work in some states than others. But as more states offer more options to families, demand will rise and pressure will mount on those who have not yet embraced the opportunity.

Ultimately, Education Freedom Scholarships require only one thing: students and parents must be empowered to make decisions and choices. America's families should decide how education dollars are spent for their own children. To most of us, that's common sense. To an elite few, it's a threat.

But freedom is never a threat. The only folks who are threatened are the same ones who have a vested financial interest in suppressing education freedom.

So, you'll hear that our proposal is an attack on public education. But beware: that's fake news!

The program won't take a single cent from local public school teachers or public school students. In fact, some states may choose to use the scholarships to enhance and improve already existing public school choices.

And let's stop and think about what public education really is.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently said it well: "If the taxpayer is paying for education, it's public education."

He's right!

And if the purpose of public education is to educate the public, then it does not matter what defining word comes before school.

Because education isn't about school buildings or school systems. Education is about school children.

In his State of the Union address, President Trump called on Congress to "pass School Choice for America's children." Education Freedom Scholarships are a powerful way students can prepare for successful careers and meaningful lives.

So it's time to get to work! America's children are watching and waiting for adults to take action. This is it! Not one student can wait another year, another election cycle or another generation.

For adults, the choice is clear: continue to play politics and protect "what is," or choose to be bold and do what's right for students.

President Trump and I will choose to stand with students—who are our future—every single time!

I want to especially acknowledge the strong leaders here with us today who feel the same way. Congressman Byrne and Senator Cruz, thank you for your leadership and thank you for your commitment to kids. And thank you to the many Members of Congress who have and will step forward to support this critical proposal.

And, finally, thank you all for being here! Education Freedom Scholarships are truly about all of you.

Thank you.

**Address by Audrey Azoulay, the Director-General of UNESCO, on the occasion of the online ministerial meeting “COVID-19 and Education”10 March 2020**

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, We have with us today 72 countries, including around 40 ministers for education, and high-level representatives of many education ministries. You are all connected today. If I can give you just one piece of advice, please mute your microphones to begin with, so there is no background noise, and then we’ll start and I’ll hand the floor over to you.

We are connected today to share our experiences and support dialogue, in addition to tabling your questions and concerns. Our request for a meeting met with a significant response, which I believe shows our need to support dialogue, to learn from all of our experiences, to anticipate the needs we all have regarding this common challenge, and to provide a framework for peer learning.

This ability to convene people and share experiences is exactly why we need international cooperation and why UNESCO was created. We face a common challenge: that of ensuring the uninterrupted education of all children and youth in an equitable manner, in the context of massive school closures due to COVID-19.

The latest figures that we have, as of this morning, are that schools and universities are closed in 15 countries worldwide, affecting some 363 million learners. Another 14 countries have implemented partial school closures, and should their closures be expanded countrywide, an additional 540 million learners would be affected.

In modern times, this is the first instance that we have seen education disrupted on such a global scale. Of grave concern is that children and youth from more vulnerable and disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to lose out in terms of learning, as they lack adequate support.

So we must spare no effort in collectively ensuring an inclusive and equitable policy response. However, these difficult times could also be an opportunity for us to learn. During this crisis, we are learning how to put open and distance learning systems to the test. It brings to centre stage the tremendous diversity of learning tools that exist, including platforms and applications for remote learning.

It is also an opportunity to learn for the future after this crisis, to look further ahead on how to make education systems more resilient, more open and more innovative, to put technology at the service of teaching and learning. The purpose of this meeting is to share experiences and showcase the solutions we have to ensure the continuity of learning –which may use different levels of technology.

Some are very sophisticated, such as national cloud platforms; others are very simple, as we’ve seen in the past –for instance, radio programming or a mobile application that can be used offline. These solutions depend on local and national needs and contexts, and on the level of technology available.

This is why we felt that it was important for UNESCO to act urgently. We just put in place an education response taskforce, which is coordinated by Stefania Giannini, UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for Education, whom you all know. We are also making a web platform that is accessible to all, which will include available examples of digital and traditional learning solutions and open educational resources.

We want this platform to be a space for dialogue and peer learning. We stand ready to work with you, education ministries and the broader education community, to provide further immediate solutions and to strengthen national capacities for the future. We will also continue to monitor the situation on a daily basis to assess country needs and mobilize responses.

I think we all feel that, at times like these, we see the meaning of international cooperation, when we face international challenges. This is why we need more cooperation and solidarity. I would like to thank all the teams here and my colleagues at UNESCO for stepping up to these responsibilities. I wish you all a fruitful meeting and I now pass the floor to Stefania Giannini, our ADG for Education.

**Prepared Remarks by Secretary DeVos at the Education Writers Association 72nd National Seminar - May 6, 2019**

Thank you for that introduction, and thank you for hosting me today. Education is an issue I tend to think a lot about—and have for many years. I’ve followed your reporting and I appreciate all that you do as journalists.

The simple truth is: I never imagined I’d be a focus of your coverage. I don’t enjoy the publicity that comes with my position. I don’t love being up on stage or on any kind of platform. I’m an introvert. As much as many in the media use my name as clickbait or try to make it all about me, it’s not. Education is not about Betsy DeVos nor any other individual.

It’s about students. It’s about acknowledging the innate value of every single one of them. And embracing the belief that each one has an important role to play—a purpose. If you accept that, then each of them should have the freedom to develop and achieve their fullest potential. That is why I’m here.

I entered public life to promote policies that empower all families. Notice that I said “families,” not government. It should surprise no one that I am a common-sense conservative with a healthy distrust of centralized government. Instead, I trust the American people to live their own lives and to decide their own destinies. That’s a freedom philosophy.

So, I look forward to discussing our Education Freedom Scholarships proposal at length. It’s one that deserves accurate reporting and fair analysis. So, first of all, in too many stories about our proposal, I see the term “public money.” And I’m reminded of something another education secretary often said.

Margaret Thatcher said that government “has no source of money other than the money people earn themselves.” There is no such thing as “public money.” The Iron Lady was right!

Our proposal allows people to direct money they themselves have earned. They will voluntarily contribute to non-profit organizations that provide scholarships directly to students. It’s a much more effective and efficient way of getting resources to students who need them the most.

Second, Education Freedom Scholarships aren’t only for students who want to attend private schools. In fact, some states may choose to design scholarships for public school options, such as apprenticeships or dual-enrollment or transportation to a different public school. Each state has the opportunity to be really imaginative and to serve the unique needs of students in their state.

Third, let’s get the terminology right about schools and school choice. Charter schools are public schools. Vouchers are not tax-credits nor are they tax-deductions nor education savings accounts nor 529 accounts. There are many different mechanisms that empower families to choose the education that’s right for their children. And they are just that, mechanisms. So, the phrase, “vouchers for charter schools,” for instance, is nonsensical.

And fourth, let’s stop and rethink the definition of public education. Today, it’s often defined as one-type of school, funded by taxpayers, controlled by government. But if every student is part of “the public,” then every way and every place a student learns is ultimately of benefit to “the public.” That should be the new definition of public education.

While it is true that 90 percent of students today are enrolled in traditional public schools, it’s also true that 60 percent of their parents say they would prefer something different if only they had the freedom to choose.

So, I’ll continue to fight for their freedom, and freedom for all. Thank you and I look forward to our conversation.

A**ddress by Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO on the occasion of the event: Global Business Coalition for Education**

Thank you Sarah Brown for this introduction. Since this is my first opportunity to join you as UNESCO Director- General, let me say how much I welcome the spirit of partnership in action that brings us together this morning.

Earlier this month in Mendoza, Argentina, I attended the first ever meeting of G20 Education Ministers, held back-to-back with a joint meeting with labour ministers.

In a joint declaration, ministers committed to building solid bridges between education, training and employment, to address disparities and inequalities, and to design more effective policies based on dialogue between public, private and social actors.

This commitment paves the way for our discussion today. I would like to suggest four framing points for this discussion.

The First challenge relates to learning crisis, 6 out of 10 children and adolescents are not achieving minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. At the risk of stating the obvious, we must improve the quality of education to ensure that all children and youth acquire strong foundation skills such as literacy and numeracy, together with “21st century skills” that we know are vital for employment today:

problem solving, collaboration, critical thinking and creativity, to cite only a few.

The only certainty being of uncertainty in the technological revolution ahead of us, we will have to reinvent ourselves many times in a lifetime and must learn all life long. This is a first ’wrong to right’- to invest in transforming education towards better quality and inclusion for all.

Second, we need to bridge mismatches between skills and labour markets by better anticipating demands and identifying opportunities in green and digital economies. This is a starting point for reforming education and training systems, for building more flexible bridges with labour markets and ensuring lifelong learning.

UNESCO assists countries in this process, which led in Madagascar for example to a full-fledged reform of technical and vocational education in close collaboration with companies and communities. Business leaders can play a forefront role here by prioritizing work-based learning- in itself a smart investment in their future.

Third, we need a strong emphasis on gender, with targeted measures, including to improve employment prospects for women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. It is vital if we want to benefit from women’s contributions in societies of knowledge and technology.

Fourth, when responding to crisis and conflict affected situations, we must ensure that education comes first. Whether it relates to emergency responses and more long- term recovery, investing in education supports the protection of children and youth from attack and abuse.

This is why UNESCO is for example supporting catch-up classes for children that missed schooling in Syria, literacy classes and skills classes for women in Afghanistan or supporting transitional education planning

We must build alliances, implement long-term strategies, learn from international experiences and showcase best practices, and I am sure that we will be inspired by the sharing of experiences that will be made here today.

Thank you for your attention.

**WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19**  
**6 March 2020**

Good afternoon, and thank you once again for joining us in person and online. I would like to start by acknowledging International Women’s Day this Sunday. This is a moment to remember that around the world, many women cannot access essential health services, and continue to suffer disproportionately from preventable and treatable diseases. But International Women’s Day is an opportunity not only to promote and protect the health of women, but to highlight the vital role they play in promoting and protecting the health of all people.

Globally, women make up 70% of the global health workforce, but hold only 25% of senior roles. WHO is committed to promoting gender equality everywhere, and especially in the health workforce. We’re proud that we have achieved gender equality in our senior leadership team at WHO headquarters, although we know we still have work to do in other parts of the Organization.

Women are also playing a vital role in the response to COVID-19, and we’re proud to have many amazing women leading our response in WHO, including Maria, Sylvie, Soumya, Ana Maria, Mariângela, Marie Pierre, Adriana, Gabby, Nyka and many others. In the past 24 hours, 2736 cases of COVID-19 were reported from 47 countries and territories. There is now a total of 98,023 reported cases of COVID-19 globally, and 3380 deaths. We are now on the verge of reaching 100,000 confirmed cases.

As cases increase, we are continuing to recommend that all countries make containment their highest priority. We continue to call on countries to find, test, isolate and care for every case, and to trace every contact. Slowing down the epidemic saves lives, and it buys time for preparedness and for research and development. Every day we can slow down the epidemic is another day hospitals can prepare themselves for cases. Every day we slow down the epidemic is another day governments can prepare their health workers to detect, test, treat and care for patients. Every day we slow down the epidemic is another day closer to having vaccines and therapeutics, which can in turn prevent infections and save lives.

As you know, last month WHO convened a meeting of more than 400 scientists to identify research priorities. Hundreds of ideas were discussed and debated, and today we are publishing an R&D roadmap which distills those ideas into a core group of priorities in 9 key areas. These include the natural history of the virus, epidemiology, vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical management, ethical considerations, social sciences and more.

The R&D roadmap focuses on research that can save lives now, as well as longer-term research priorities for vaccines and therapeutics. It’s vital to coordinate research so that different groups around the world complement each other, so WHO can give better advice, and countries can take evidence-based decisions that save lives. That’s why WHO has developed a set of core protocols that outline standards for how studies should be done, and to collect critical data so we can compare apples with apples and pool data from multiple studies.

France and South Africa have already indicated they will use these protocols for clinical trials, and we encourage other countries to do the same. We’re also developing research protocols to assess interventions for disenfranchised communities such as refugees and internally displaced persons. We’re very encouraged by the level of interest around the world in accelerating research as part of the response.

So far WHO has received applications for review and approval of 40 diagnostic tests, 20 vaccines are in development and many clinical trials of therapeutics are underway. Even as we test therapeutics, we need to ensure that supplies of those medicines are available should they prove effective. WHO has been monitoring the potential risk of a disruption to medicines supplies as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic.

China, as you know, is a major producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and the intermediate products that are used to produce medicines in other countries. WHO has focused on the most essential medicines that are critical for primary health care and emergencies, including antibiotics, pain killers, and treatments for diabetes, hypertension, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.

WHO is working closely with industry associations, regulators and other partners to monitor this risk, and so far we have not identified any imminent specific shortages. Many manufacturers either have alternative sources of ingredients, or had stocks to draw on. Manufacturing has now resumed in most places in China, although some challenges remain.

Separately, WHO has developed a list of more than 20 essential medical devices that countries need to manage patients, including ventilators and oxygen supply systems. Access to medical oxygen could be the difference between life and death for some patients, but there is already a shortage in many countries, which could be exacerbated by this epidemic. WHO has an existing working group with the Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative and PATH, and we are building on that partnership to increase access to oxygen.

We encourage every country to review WHO’s disease commodity package for COVID-19 to ensure it has the supplies it needs, including protective equipment and medical devices. All of this requires the involvement of the private sector to ensure countries can access life-saving products. You’ve heard me talk about the market failure for personal protective equipment. You’ve heard me talk about the need for a whole-of-government approach.

You’ve heard me talk about what individuals can do to protect themselves and others. We look forward to businesses stepping up to play their part. We need you. WHO is working with the World Economic Forum to engage companies around the world, and earlier this week I spoke to more than 200 CEOs about how they can protect their staff and customers, ensure business continuity and contribute to the response. As I keep saying, we’re all in this together, and we all have a role to play. Facts not fear. Reason not rumours. Solidarity not stigma. I thank you.

**WHO Director-General's remarks at 40th anniversary of smallpox eradication**  
**- 13 December 2019**

Ambassador Gatilov, Ambassador Braithwaite, Ambassador Bremberg, Excellencies, distinguished guests, dear colleagues and friends, It is such an honor to be here with you today to commemorate the 40th anniversary of smallpox eradication.

I remember walking through the streets of Asmara with my mother as a small boy, and seeing posters about smallpox in the street in the early 1970s. That is also the first time I encountered WHO. In our language we call it Ye alem t'ena dirigit

Now, when I leave the office every evening, and when I come in, I see the smallpox memorial statue, and I remember the street in Asmara where I used to walk with my mother and have fresh memories of the smallpox eradication effort.

Today, with this plaque, we recognize the day – 9 December 1979 – when smallpox was confirmed to have been eradicated. Five months later, the 33rd World Health Assembly officially declared that “the world and its peoples have won freedom from smallpox.”

Today, smallpox is the only human disease ever eradicated, a testimony to what we can achieve when all nations work together. When it comes to epidemic disease, we have a shared responsibility and a shared destiny. With this plaque, we commemorate the heroes around the world who came together to fight smallpox and worked to keep future generations safe until it was wiped out.

As you know, smallpox has plagued humanity for thousands of years, killing 300 million people in the 20th century alone. The smallpox eradication programme taught us many lessons, which we still use today. Our experience with smallpox informs the strategies and tools we now use to fight polio and Ebola, such as disease surveillance, health promotion, and ring vaccination.

We use the lessons learned from smallpox when we take on emerging epidemic diseases such as Zika, MERS, and now monkeypox. Smallpox also laid the foundation for national childhood immunization programmes worldwide, which are critical to primary health care and the movement for universal health coverage.

At the same time, smallpox preparedness remains at the heart of global health security initiatives to protect people everywhere.

Yet today, we are facing a lack of trust in public institutions, widespread vaccine hesitancy and disinformation - as Ambassdaor Braithwaite said, and glaring gaps in our immunization coverage for the most vulnerable.

The result has been catastrophic. Globally, measles killed 140 thousand people last year, many of them infants and young children. The fact that any child is afflicted by a vaccine-preventable disease such as measles is an outrage. Yet less than 70 percent of children worldwide are getting the second dose of measles vaccine, when it should be 95 percent.

Globally, there are more than 13 million children, many of them in fragile states and conflict-affected countries, who are entirely left out of vaccination services. We are not protecting the world’s most vulnerable children. This is a collective failure.

The success of smallpox eradication shows us what is possible, and has allowed us to dream of another major public health achievement – the eradication of polio. We have brought polio to the brink of eradication, but we are not there yet.

We must continue with even greater commitment and determination until polio is eradicated. As you know, the last mile is the hardest mile. And let us remember – the smallpox vaccine was invented in 1796 by the English physician Dr Edward Jenner.

Dr. Jenner predicted that ‘the annihilation of the smallpox’ – the most dreadful scourge of humanity - must be the ‘final result’ of the vaccine. So he predicted it. And in fact, it took nearly 200 years.

The three countries here with us today had a big role. As Ambassador Gatilov said, the USSR proposed the eradication, and Dr Henderson of the USA led the effort. Thank you to all who participated in ending smallpox.

The lesson from smallpox is very clear – technology is not enough. The best vaccines in the world do not help us if people are not getting them. As Ambassador Gatilov said, this achievement was done in the middle of the Cold War. So anything is possible and we cannot have any excuse with polio or other diseases.

We must invest in immunization programmes, public health communication, and strong primary care. But above all, we had global solidarity, which was really visible, and which we should celebrate, a solidarity even with our differences. That is the only way we can achieve health for all, protect people from these devastating outbreaks and make the world a safer place.

Finally I am really proud to join you, and hope that this will inspire us to do more for the people we serve. Thank you so much.

**Remarks on Financing the Future: Education For All ---- 2023. António Guterres**

Dear friends, let me begin by saluting this impressive coalition of global leaders and youth here today. Thank you for standing up for education. We are also graced by the presence of the most world famous student. Welcome, Malala Yousafzai – our youngest UN Messenger of Peace. My commitment to education runs deep. Long before I served at the United Nations or in politics in my own country, in Portugal, I started as a teacher. I saw for myself decades ago in the schools and slums of Lisbon why education is a basic human right, a transformational force for poverty eradication, an engine for sustainability, and a force for peace.

Yet universal education is still a distant dream for so many around the world. More than 260 million children, adolescents and youth are out of school, and most of them are girls. Let me point to four areas of focus where, together, I believe we must do more. Above all, finance. Investing in education is the most cost effective way to drive economic development, improve skills and opportunities for young women and men, to unlock progress on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals and to prevent conflict and sustain peace.

We must work with governments and donors to increase education funding around the world, and to develop new approaches that go beyond Official Development Assistance. Earlier this year, I conveyed to the G-20 the proposal of an International Finance Facility for Education. We are aiming to launch it next year through the Education Commission. The Global Partnership for Education’s Financing Conference is our first opportunity to turn political commitment into tangible support. I have to say that, in the G-20 meeting, immediately after I spoke, I had enthusiastic support from the Prime Minister of Norway, who is sitting on our side.

Second — we must focus on girls. Girls face a range of barriers from gender-based violence to schools that lack separate toilet facilities to the social and cultural norms that prevent girls from even attending school in some parts of the world. Overcoming these challenges requires quality secondary education, as well. Just 1 per cent of poor rural young women in low-income countries complete secondary school. Yet every year of secondary schooling a girl receives boosts her earning power by as much as 25 per cent.

Third — lifelong learning. Over the next ten years, one billion young people will enter the global workforce. They need the skills for the jobs of today and tomorrow. We are witnessing the fourth industrial revolution. We are witnessing enormous progress, namely in artificial intelligence. Labour markets will be dramatically changed in the years to come. Not only labour markets – international relations and the fabric of societies. I don’t see governments and international organizations paying sufficient attention to this huge transformation that is coming.

And we need to make sure that when we talk about education, when we talk about skills, when we talk about our policies, that we take into account not only what is happening today but what we now can foresee will happen, and will happen quite soon in the years to come. Fourth — a focus on children and youth affected by conflict. Half of all refugee children are not in primary school, and only 75 per cent of adolescents are in secondary school. There is an immediate need and a challenge that is crucial to building a more peaceful, equal world. All of this highlights the importance of the Education Cannot Wait For you.

Mothers and fathers around the world would make any sacrifice for their children’s education. Most of us in this room are fortunate. We may have the resources, the access and the privilege to help ensure the very best education for our families. Let us commit as a family of nations to ensure quality education for all the world’s children. Financing education is indeed the best investment we can make for a better world and a better future. Thank you very much.

**Remarks at COP25 event on Climate Action for Jobs, António Guterres**

Dear friends, We are still losing the climate race. On our current trajectory we are looking at a 3- to 4-degree temperature rise by the end of the century. But we can choose another path. The path of climate action and well-being for people and planet. And this path is about people’s jobs, health, education, opportunities, and their future.

Today, millions of workers are on the front lines of climate impacts. Many in sectors like tourism and agriculture are losing livelihoods. Others have to withstand unbearable working conditions. The answer to the climate crisis lies in transforming how we generate our power, design our cities, and manage our land.

But also requires that our actions are consistent with making people’s lives better. It means ensuring that national commitments under the Paris Agreement include a just transition for people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected as we move from the grey economy to the green. To achieve our Sustainable Development Goals we must leave no one behind.

Dear friends, We can no longer refuse to face up to the climate crisis.

Governments have to commit, businesses have to lead, and people everywhere have to embrace the transformation that will bring us to a carbon-neutral world by 2050. It sounds daunting – but we too often overlook the enormous opportunities linked to climate action.

The New Climate Economy tells us that shifting to a low-carbon economy represents a $26 trillion-dollar growth opportunity that could create 65 million new jobs by 2030.

Today, the fastest-growing job creators in several economies are those related to solar, wind and geothermal energy and related businesses. The green economy is the economy of the future and we need to make way for it right now.

Many governments and businesses are already racing to capitalize on it, and rethinking how to conceptualize value in a new, greener economic model. Spain, our host, is an excellent example of how dialogue with workers and caring for their needs can lead to more prosperous and healthy communities. We need all countries and sectors to make sure that they do this, by re-training people so they can switch careers with the concept that education now became a lifelong enterprise.

They need to take gender balance into account, create fair and decent job conditions and capitalize on this opportunity to improve social equity and leave no one behind. It is essential that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, when great transitions have left people, communities and entire nations falling by the wayside.

We must ensure the transition to a low-carbon future is fair and inclusive. That means a future of green and decent jobs. A future of thriving, resilient communities, cities and countries. A future where developing nations are not raided for resources and human capital but are treated as equal partners. And a future where the skills and knowledge of those currently employed in traditional energy industries provide the foundational expertise for the clean industries of tomorrow.

To workers in the traditional energy industries, I have a clear message. Those of us leading on climate action are not adversaries. We want the same thing as you: decent jobs in a cleaner, healthier world.

For that, government, businesses and labour leaders must work together to develop a pathway to a carbon-neutral world, where women and men can earn a living in jobs that will not damage their health or the environment.

Dear friends,

At the September Climate Action Summit in New York, we announced the “Climate Action for Jobs” initiative, developed with the International Labour Organization, Spain and Peru.

The initiative puts job creation and protecting livelihoods at the centre of national climate action plans. We now have more than 40 countries committed to developing a just transition plan. Climate Action for Jobs sets out specific measures to make nation climate plans inclusive.

They include:

Boosting skills development, particularly for women and marginalized groups that risk falling further behind as a result of a fast-paced change.

Designing innovative social protection policies to protect workers and vulnerable groups.

Assessing the employment, social and economic impacts of ecological transition and the potential of green jobs.

And increasing the transfer of technology and knowledge to developing countries, alongside innovation and responsible investment.

We are also working together at the international level -- under the UNFCCC – on the just transition of the work force and the creation of decent work and quality jobs. This work accelerated under the Polish Presidency of the COP, and we thank them for driving this issue.

Dear friends,

A just transition is not only necessary, it is possible, but it will only work if governments and businesses continue to boost their overall climate action as well.

For too long, vested interests have peddled the false story that economic growth and tackling climate change are incompatible.

This is nonsense. The truth is that they are mutually reinforcing. In fact, failing to tackle global heating is a sure-fire recipe for economic disaster. That is why we must continue to use the Paris Agreement as our multilateral path forward.

We need to reduce emissions 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and stabilize global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Without achieving our climate goals, there will be no just transition – just the survival of the richest.

For the past year, I’ve been saying we need to make progress on carbon pricing, ensure no new coal plants are built by 2020, and end the allocation of massive amounts of taxpayers’ money for fossil fuel subsidies. We cannot continue to have one foot in both the grey and the green economies at the same time.

To that end, we must also ensure that developed nations fulfil their pledges under the Paris Agreement to mobilize at least $100 billion dollars a year for mitigation and adaptation in developing nations.

This is not charity. It is about driving climate action and ensuring we all achieve our collective climate goals – and our Sustainable Development Goals – as quickly as possible, and as fairly as possible.

By ensuring a just transition, we can address climate change in a way that is truly inclusive. Let us all respect the need for climate action today, while leaving nobody behind in our efforts to achieve a cleaner, greener and more prosperous future for all.

Let’s be imaginative. If we use the money that we can get taxing carbon to reduce the taxes on payroll we have a win-win situation. We are fighting climate change and we are creating the conditions for more jobs to be established and for the income of workers to be improved. So we need to be innovative, we need to be determined and we need to be entirely coherent with the perspective that this transition needs to be done to benefit everybody and not doing this transition will only allow, as I said, the survival of the richest.

Thank you very much.

**Preventing the next pandemic: Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission**  
**Statement by Inger Andersen, UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme**

Thank you for joining us for the launch of a new report by the UN Environment Programme and the International Livestock Research Institute. The report is about the wider issue of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19, and how to minimize them.

So, what does the report tell us?

COVID-19 is one of the worst zoonotic diseases, but it is not the first. Ebola, SARS, MERS, HIV, Lyme disease, Rift Valley fever and Lassa fever preceded it. In the last century we have seen at least six major outbreaks of novel coronaviruses. Sixty per cent of known infectious diseases and 75 per cent of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic. Over the last two decades and before COVID-19, zoonotic diseases caused economic damage of USD 100 billion.

Tragically, two million people in low- and middle-income countries die each year from neglected endemic zoonotic diseases – such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis and rabies. These are often communities with complex development problems, high dependence on livestock and proximity to wildlife.

Growth in humanity and its activity is largely to blame. Meat production has increased by 260 per cent in 50 years. We have intensified agriculture, expanded infrastructure and extracted resources at the expense of our wild spaces. Dams, irrigation and factory farms are linked to 25 per cent of infectious diseases in humans. Travel, transport and food supply chains have erased borders and distances. Climate change has contributed to the spread of pathogens.

The end result is that people and animals, with the diseases they carry, are closer than ever.

There are many solutions, which will also help to fight climate change and biodiversity loss. We need to invest in ending the over-exploitation of wildlife and other natural resources, farming sustainably, reversing land degradation and protecting ecosystem health.

Part of this process is the urgent adoption of integrated human, animal and environmental health expertise and policy – a One Health approach. One Health is not new, but uneven uptake and institutional support means it hasn’t hit its potential. The weakest link in the chain is environmental health. We have to fix this.

We were warned that the current pandemic was a matter of if, not when. It is a human failing that we predict but not prepare. Now we must become more proactive to avoid another pandemic and address endemic zoonotic diseases. This means recognizing that human health, animal health and planetary health cannot be separated, and planning our responses accordingly.

**A just transition to a pollution-free planet (2학기 UNEP 수업자료)**  
**SPEECH DELIVERED BY: Inger Andersen**

My thanks to my dear colleague Steffi Lemke for hosting the second Berlin Forum on Chemicals and Sustainability. My thanks also to the participants for their efforts to pursue a just transition towards a pollution-free planet. And for accelerating the momentum ahead of the expected adoption of an ambitious new global chemicals instrument at the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) later this month.

Friends,

Back in 1972, around the time of the Stockholm Conference, pollution was the most-visible and most-concerning issue of the day. This was the time of bubbling rivers and acid rain. Today, we understand that humanity faces a wider range of interlinked threats through the triple planetary crisis: the crisis of climate change, the crisis of nature and biodiversity loss, and the crisis of pollution and waste.

Climate change and nature and biodiversity loss have become the highest profile crises, and the focus of national and international action. But this is not a zero-sum game. The intensification of these two crises have not diminished the pollution and waste crisis, which is itself growing more intense - and, as I said before, closely linked to the other two crises. The unsustainable management of chemicals across the life cycle, right from when they are manufactured, is central to the issue.

Chemicals do bring great benefits to humanity. They are essential building blocks for medicines, consumer products, food and more. But the flip side is that hazardous and often long-lived chemicals are polluting our air, water, land and bodies. You know the issues and the numbers. More than two million people dying each year from direct chemical pollution. The illnesses and productivity losses. The grave harm to ecosystems and other species.

You also know the economic case for sustainable chemicals and waste management. Yes, the global chemical industry is a behemoth. It exceeded US$ 5 trillion in 2017 and is expected to double by 2030, driven by global megatrends. Some people are making a lot of money. But with these profits come damage and costs - particularly for the poorest and most-vulnerable who are exposed to chemical pollution.

UNEP’s Global Chemicals Outlook showed that when health and environment impacts are considered, the costs of current practices outweigh the benefits. So, it is on nations, the international community, and the industry itself to retain and expand the benefits of chemicals while ensuring they do not cause harm.

Friends,

While the growth in the industry is creating problems, it is also creating opportunities to advance sustainable consumption, production and product innovation. The kind of innovation UNEP has been calling for as the world negotiates a deal to end plastic pollution. In that regard, chemists, manufacturers and process engineers must get creative, now, to design out harmful and unnecessary plastics. The same applies across the wider chemicals industry, where investments in green and sustainable chemistry are sorely lacking.

Change requires ambitious and widespread action by all sectors where chemicals are used intensively, such as agriculture, construction and manufacturing. Governments are critical to create the policy environment and incentivize industry to adapt their business practices. And we must support the 100 countries that do not have basic legal systems and institutional capacities to enable the safe management of chemicals.

We are seeing progress. At the fifth UN Environment Assembly, member states agreed to establish a Science Policy Panel for chemicals, waste and the prevention of pollution. This panel will be key to informing the highest priority issues for the new chemicals instrument. And, of course, we have seen increased political traction and momentum towards the setting of this new instrument in three weeks’ time. This instrument will be critical to the just transition. We must get it right.

The new instrument should be clear on what governments need to do to create the policy and regulatory environment to shift business practices. Be clear on what the industry and its financial backers must do. Be inclusive, in line with modern multilateralism, to bring in civil society, indigenous groups, local communities, workers, consumers and youth. And, as ever with such agreements, the framework must be clear on how it will unlock funding and investment opportunities.

This means realigning incentives in high-impact economic sectors to maximize innovation, reduce negative impacts and end the long-lasting legacies of chemical pollution. This means voluntary industry initiatives, to be reflected in the new framework and applied across manufacturing and supply chains. This means repurposing subsidies in agriculture to enable food productivity, food safety, worker safety, and human and environmental health.

This also means leveraging innovations in financing. Sustainable public procurement. Using public budgets to leverage changes in the private sector. Extended producer responsibility. Green bonds. And more.

Friends,

We should be able to feed ourselves. Clothe ourselves. Live in our homes. Go to our workplaces. Walk, run and swim in nature. All without fear of sickening and dying from inappropriate chemical exposure. This is the world we must create.

And let me remind you of the role that green and sustainable chemistry can play in dampening the whole triple planetary crisis. Safe chemicals and products can boost the fight against climate change and nature loss - including by helping to achieve the goals of the Global Biodiversity Framework. They can increase reuse and recycling in a circular economy. And they can contribute to wider development goals.

I thank you for your efforts so far, and urge all parties involved to create a strong and ambitious instrument in Bonn. One that creates the conditions for a just transition to a greener and more sustainable chemicals industry. And, ultimately, helps to bring about a pollution-free world.

**Investing in planetary resilience 28 FEB 2023**

Distinguished delegates, My thanks for the invitation to speak to you today about the collaboration between the United Nations Environment Programme and WFP and about how we can strengthen our joint work on addressing the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. This work is crucial. Because there can be no peace, no stability, and no end to hunger and poverty without healthy nature and a healthy climate. Many of the crises to which WFP responds, such as the searing drought in the Horn of Africa, are intensified, or caused, by climate change. Floods in low-lying deltas and coastal zones due to sea level rise and greater intensity of storms. The collapse of glacial lakes. Drought, increasing desertification and the associated reduced productivity of the land. Climate change is here, now.

Inadequate global action on bringing down emissions means we can expect far worse in the future. In 2019, climate change was linked to the displacement of over 70 per cent of 33 million people. And some estimates indicate that by 2050 climate change could internally displace 216 million people. As the UN Secretary-General has said, the climate crisis has escalating implications for international peace and security. Closely linked is the water challenge. By 2050, an estimated six billion people will face water scarcity due to climate change, pollution and increasingly unsustainable consumption and production. Degradation and loss of land fertility, and associated natural habitats and biodiversity, is another threat.

Millions of people are facing extreme hunger and severe food shortages. Hundreds of millions of people face hunger every day. Billions of people struggle to afford a healthy, balanced diet. And billions of hectares of productive land are degraded. Our productive seas and waterways are increasingly polluted. The estimated annual market value of food dependent on pollinators is over half a trillion dollars. Yet these pollinators are in decline. This perfect storm of environmental factors is undermining our efforts to meet the sustainable development goals. This perfect storm makes it crystal clear that the mandates of UNEP and WFP are intertwined. We can only calm this storm by investing in the foundations of human and planetary resilience: vibrant and healthy nature and a stable climate.

Friends, WFP and UNEP are partners that play to each other’s strengths. WFP has the mandate to eradicate hunger and malnutrition and a massive presence on the ground. UNEP has the technical and scientific know-how to secure ecosystems, mitigate and adapt to climate change and create sustainable consumption and production, to generate equitable benefits for people and nature. Together, we can help to break the cycle of hunger, poverty and humanitarian crises through nature-centred, as well as people –centered, solutions. The way I see it, there are three key areas behind which WFP and UNEP can unite. The first area is resilience and adaptation through investments in nature-based solutions and early warning systems.

Look, even if we were to turn off the tap on greenhouse gas emissions today, the proverbial bathtub is still nearly full. Indeed, to remain at 1.5 degrees Celsius we have around 400-500 Gt of CO2 left to emit before we zip past that limit. If we want to remain at 2 degrees, we have around 1,150-1,350 Gt of CO2 left. Consider that in 2019 we emitted 59 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent and that between then and now, we have increased, not decreased, our emissions load. So, the CO2 tap is, for the moment, still wide open. Climate impacts are here to stay. They will intensify. We must help vulnerable nations and communities adapt to long-term changes and plan to survive disasters.

This means focusing on resilience through nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation, as WFP and UNEP are doing, for example, in South Sudan. In partnership, we are developing a Green Climate Fund proposal to enhance integrated land and water resource management in Eastern Equatoria. This will improve the resilience of communities to floods and droughts. And there is no doubt that science-based, data-driven climate services and early warning systems save lives and livelihoods. Around 1.4 million people in Least-Developed countries lost their lives to weather, climate and water-related hazards in the fifty years leading up to 2020. Yet only 40 per cent of 138 World Meteorological Organization countries have multi-hazard early warning systems in play.

We need to see more of what is happening in Lesotho, for example, where UNEP and WFP are supporting vulnerable communities to receive access to climate information and forecasting systems. Coupled with local adaptation strategies – such as crop diversification, water harvesting and grassland restoration – this is helping communities build resilience. By working together on identifying common programmes, sharing tools and science, and co-mobilizing resources, UNEP and WFP can bring such projects to many more people.

The second area is nature-positive, climate friendly food systems. It’s obvious that our food systems need to reform. Agri-food systems are responsible for around 30 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. They are causing damage through fertilizers and pesticides, and the leakage of antimicrobials. They are very wasteful, with huge amounts of food lost between farms and markets – up to 40 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. They are over-reliant on just a few crops, with wheat, corn and rice making up around 60 per cent of the world’s food energy intake.

But there is a lot we can do. For example, UNEP is developing agroecological approaches that work with nature to support resilient and genetically diverse species of crops, livestock and soil microbes. Agrobiodiverse diets improve human health and nutrition, while these approaches also control the use of harmful chemicals, antibiotics and other unnecessary nutrient inputs.

On the food loss front, the lack of effective cold chain is estimated to result in losses of 475 million tonnes, or 13 per cent, of total food production globally. But UNEP, with WFP and other partners, is working towards the widespread adoption of energy-efficient and climate friendly cold-chain solutions in the agriculture and health sectors. The benefits of climate friendly cold chain are many and varied. Beyond making more food available, cold chain brings economic empowerment for farmers, increased export revenues and the mitigation of environmental impacts, to name but a few. By working together to take cold chain innovations to scale in WFP and partner operations, collaborating on Country Food Systems Reviews, and working with the finance sector, donors and private partners to finance nature-positive food systems, UNEP and WFP can start to steer food systems in the right direction.

The third area is integrated water resource management. As I mentioned earlier, water scarcity is a serious and growing concern. In sub-Saharan Africa, irrigated areas are expected to double by 2050, but this water must come from somewhere. Because we need water for people, water for food, water for industry, but also water for nature. Failing the latter, we risk breaking natural cycles, interfering with soil moisture and the hydrological cycle and risking longer term impacts for people and for planet. Around 41 per cent of global irrigation water use is at the expense of environmental flow requirements. So, we need to get better at using ever scarcer water.

Research shows that water-harvesting and conservation could boost rainfed kilocalorie production by up to 24 per cent, so this is a real option. And UNEP projects are proving that such interventions work. In Darfur, for example, we are collaborating on the EU-funded Wadi El Ku Catchment Management Project which has been helping 200,000 farmers cope with dry conditions and reducing resource conflict. These farmers are using climate-smart methods such as nature-based water harvesting, improved seeds and livestock breeds, erosion-control techniques and much more. In Kenya, UNEP and WFP are working with the country team to build a new programme for an integrated water and food security response in the ten most drought-affected regions of the country.

UNEP and WFP can take such work to scale to reach more people and ecosystems. Roll out water monitoring and management tools to ensure they are captured in WFP’s climate adaptive, food system transformation. Integrate common social and environmental resilience and safeguards in the work of UN Country Teams. In short, friends, there is much that UNEP and WFP can do together to build resilience through ecosystem-based adaptation and nature-based solutions.

The joint areas of our work are clear: the food, energy and water nexus. Our complementary strengths are clear: WFP with the huge country presence and operational capability, and UNEP with the expertise on nature-centred solutions. If we work more closely together, we can create real, meaningful impact. We can enhance climate mitigation and adaptation. We can support vulnerable populations to address nature-induced conflicts and natural disasters. We can maintain healthy, productive and resilient ecosystems. We can, ultimately, deliver on both our mandates and reduce the vicious cycle of humanitarian crises.

Thank you.

**Secretary-General Reiterates Appeal for Global Ceasefire, Warns ‘Worst Is Yet to Come’ as COVID-19 Threatens Conflict Zones**

Ten days ago, I issued an appeal for an immediate ceasefire in all corners of the globe to reinforce diplomatic action, help create conditions for the delivery of lifesaving aid and bring hope to places that are among the most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. This call was rooted in a fundamental recognition: There should be only one fight in our world today, our shared battle against COVID-19.

We know the pandemic is having profound social, economic and political consequences, including relating to international peace and security. We see it, for example, in postponement of elections or limitations on the ability to vote, sustained restrictions on movement, spiralling unemployment and other factors that could contribute to rising discontent and political tensions. In addition, terrorist or extremist groups may take profit from the uncertainty created by the spread of the pandemic.

Nonetheless, the global ceasefire appeal is resonating across the world. The call has been endorsed by an ever-growing number of Member States, some 70 so far, regional partners, non-State actors, civil society networks and organizations, and all United Nations Messengers of Peace and Advocates for the Sustainable Development Goals.

Religious leaders — including Pope Francis — have added their moral voice in support of a global ceasefire, as have citizens through grass‑roots mobilization online. Just to mention one example, an appeal launched by [the non-governmental organization] Avaaz has already gathered support from more than 1 million people. To all, I express my deep gratitude.

Today, I am releasing an update on the impact of the global ceasefire appeal.

A substantial number of parties to conflict have expressed their acceptance for the call. As the update details, these include parties to conflict in the following countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Libya, Myanmar, Philippines, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen.

But, there is a huge distance between declarations and deeds — between translating words into peace on the ground and in the lives of people. There are enormous difficulties to implementation as conflicts have festered for years and distrust is deep, with many spoilers and many suspicions. We know that any initial gains are fragile and easily reversible. And in many of the most critical situations, we have seen no let-up in fighting, and some conflicts have even intensified.

We need robust diplomatic efforts to meet these challenges. To silence the guns, we must raise the voices for peace.

In all these situations, my Special Representatives and Special Envoys — and in some countries, the Resident Coordinators — with full support from Headquarters and, whenever required, my personal involvement — are engaging with conflict actors to help move towards ceasefires on the ground as a prerequisite to lasting peace.

Allow me to give four examples of this intense diplomatic push.

In Yemen, despite expressed support for a ceasefire by the Government, Ansar Allah and many other parties — including the Joint Forces Command — the conflict has spiked. My Special Envoy is working on preparations to convene the parties to discuss COVID‑19 crisis management and a nationwide ceasefire mechanism. I call on all Governments and movements involved and their supporters to end this catastrophic conflict and humanitarian nightmare and come to the negotiating table.

In Syria, where the first COVID‑19‑related deaths have now been reported, my Special Envoy appealed for a “complete and immediate” nationwide ceasefire in the country to allow for an all-out effort against COVID-19. The Idlib ceasefire previously negotiated by Turkey and the Russian Federation is holding. But, it is essential that a permanent nationwide ceasefire take effect to allow for expansions in humanitarian access to all those suffering for the last decade.

In Libya, the Government of National Accord and Marshal [Khalifa] Haftar’s Libyan National Army welcomed calls to stop the fighting. Yet, clashes have escalated drastically on all frontlines, obstructing efforts to effectively respond to COVID-19. I urge both parties and all others directly and indirectly involved in this conflict to immediately halt hostilities to allow authorities to effectively address the COVID-19 threat, ensure unhindered access to humanitarian aid and realize the ceasefire they have been discussing under the auspices of the United Nations.

Finally, in Afghanistan, while fighting increased, on 26 March, it was announced that a 21-member team, which includes 5 women, was formed for direct negotiations with the Taliban. The Government and the Taliban have also established technical contacts for an initial prisoner release. I believe the time has come for the Government and the Taliban to cease hostilities as COVID-19 looms over the country. I pledge my full support.

In all these enormously difficult circumstances, as in others, I make a special appeal to all countries with influence on parties waging war to do everything possible for the ceasefire to become a reality. I call on all those that can make a difference to make that difference — to urge and pressure combatants around the world to put down their arms.

There is a chance for peace, but we are far from there. And the need is urgent. The COVID-19 storm is now coming to all these theatres of conflict. The virus has shown how swiftly it can move across borders, devastate countries and upend lives. The worst is yet to come. We need to do everything possible to find the peace and unity our world so desperately needs to battle COVID-19. We must mobilize every ounce of energy to defeat it.

**Director General's Statement at International Conference on Nuclear Security: Sustaining and Strengthening Efforts**

Good morning, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.

I am very pleased to welcome you all to this IAEA International Conference on Nuclear Security. I thank Minister Aurescu of Romania and Vice-Minister Alfaro of Panama for agreeing to serve as co-Presidents. I also pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Co-chairs in ensuring that the Ministerial Declaration which you will adopt today enjoys the consensus of all participating States.

This is the third IAEA ministerial conference on nuclear security. I am pleased to see record participation by ministers, which reflects the great importance which your governments attach to this issue.

We live in a world in which nuclear activities are growing in a very sustained way. The number of nuclear power plants, laboratories and locations dealing with nuclear material is increasing. This is a magnet for groups with malicious intent, which see in this material a possibility to create panic and bring distress and pain to our societies.

The sub-title of the conference, “Sustaining and Strengthening Efforts,” is an acknowledgment that considerable progress has been made throughout the world in recent years in protecting nuclear and other radioactive material against malicious use.

But we need to do more.

Nuclear security is the responsibility of individual countries. However, the need for international cooperation to guard against nuclear terrorism is universally recognised, as is the role of the IAEA as the inclusive global platform for that cooperation.

The IAEA’s role is indispensable. Nuclear security is about more than just preventing nuclear terrorism. It is essential for ensuring that countries can enjoy the great benefits of the peaceful use of nuclear science and technology sustainably, and for maintaining public confidence. Maintaining the highest levels of nuclear security should not be seen as an obstacle to using nuclear technology, but rather as an enabler.

Contrary to perceptions in some quarters, the use of nuclear power continues to grow. More and more use is also being made of non-power applications of nuclear technology in industry, health care, agriculture, food production, and many other areas. This means that the amount of nuclear and other radioactive material in the world continues to increase, as does the number of facilities in which such material is stored. This material and these facilities must be protected against malicious use.

The IAEA offers countries practical assistance, expert advice, equipment and training to ensure that nuclear and other radioactive material, and associated facilities, are secure.

Demands for our assistance in nuclear security are constantly increasing. Let me give you a few numbers to illustrate the contribution of the IAEA since our last ministerial conference in 2016.

We provided face-to-face training to nearly 7,000 people (including police and border guards) in nuclear security. More than 6,000 other officials completed e-learning courses, which we make available in all six official IAEA languages.

We donated radiation detection equipment to 33 countries, including personal detectors and radiation portal monitors for scanning vehicles and containers at seaports and border posts. We provided practical nuclear security support at 17 major public events, including World Youth Day in Panama, which was attended by Pope Francis and the presidents of seven Latin American countries.

We lent countries more than 1,200 personal radiation detectors and related equipment for other public events. We sent 15 expert missions to advise countries on improving security at nuclear facilities, hospitals and other places where nuclear materials are held. We helped six countries to develop Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plans, which enable them to establish a comprehensive system to protect nuclear and other radioactive material.

We released 12 new publications in our Nuclear Security Series, providing very practical guidance. We continued to expand our Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB), in which 140 countries now participate. In the last three years, more than 600 new incidents of nuclear or other radioactive material going out of regulatory control were reported by 71 countries.

With active encouragement from the Agency, five countries have adhered to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its Amendment, while 10 CPPNM States have adhered to the Amendment. The Convention is the only legally binding treaty on the protection of nuclear material and it is a very important instrument. The Amendment widened its scope.

In December 2018, we hosted an International Conference on the Security of Radioactive Material, focusing on prevention and detection, with participation from more than 100 countries. As you can see, we have been busy – and this is just a selection of our activities.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Strengthening the Agency’s assistance to countries in the field of nuclear security will be a priority for me as Director General. I believe more could be done to make us a real focal point in practice, not just in name, and to improve coordination among countries. We are in a position to integrate and bring together the many valuable – but often scattered – efforts being made throughout the world to guard against nuclear terrorism and other threats, not just by governments, but also by think tanks, NGOs and others. Let us bring all such efforts home to the Agency.

I encourage all countries to make full use of IAEA expert peer review and advisory missions. These are among the most important services which we offer. I hope that, in time, IAEA nuclear security guidance will enjoy the same status as our Safety Standards. As you know, the Safety Standards are not legally binding, but, in practice, they are adhered to by all our Member States and embedded in national practice.

I believe that funding for the IAEA’s nuclear security activities needs to be put on a more sustainable footing. Nuclear security is much too important to be dependent on extra-budgetary contributions, as is the case today.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Nuclear and radioactive material will always attract malevolent interest from terrorists and other criminals. We can never relax our guard. Even countries with little or no nuclear or other radioactive material on their territory must remain vigilant. Let me conclude by thanking you once again for your presence here today, which demonstrates high-level political support for the work of the IAEA in nuclear security.

The goals you set will help to make the world safer and more secure for us all. The IAEA will continue to play its part in ensuring that those goals are translated into practical action. I wish you a very successful Conference.

Thank you.

**Taking Steps to Ensure Financial Stability in Sub-Saharan Africa in the Face of Climate Change Africa Training Institute 10th Anniversary Conference**  
**January 24, 2024**

Good morning. It is an honor to join you today at the ATI 10th Anniversary Conference. The global economy was confronted by multiple shocks over the past few years and the divergent growth prospects we are seeing since then pose a challenge to returning to pre-pandemic output trends. Climate change also contributes to the divergent growth prospects, threatening macroeconomic as well as financial stability in countries. This speaks to the importance of a well-managed and just green transition—away from fossil fuels and towards renewables.

We have seen the impact of climate physical risk on all five continents. For instance, extreme weather events of higher frequency and intensity cause damage to physical assets, markets, and productivity that in turn can affect the resilience of the banking sector. In some jurisdictions, financial stability risks stemming from climate change occur due to the impact of climate-transition policies.

Understanding the impact of these physical and transition risks on the banking sector and overall financial stability is a priority that requires paying attention to risk assessments. To help accurately assess climate physical and transition risks, central banks and financial sector supervisors need to build capacity to adapt their stress-testing frameworks. These frameworks should incorporate the channels through which climate risks amplify and transmit risks to the financial sector.

Identifying and closing data gaps is a pre-requisite for proper risk assessment. Our experience from the IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program, as well as from our technical assistance work, shows that lack of relevant climate data is common across jurisdictions. Efforts are needed to build comprehensive datasets related to physical risk projections and granular exposure data of the financial sector to both physical and transition risks. So, strengthening the architecture for data, disclosures, and taxonomies is a priority. For instance, more-comprehensive transition taxonomies would help support the growth of sustainable markets and the production of climate data that is useful for financial decision making, as well as climate-risk assessment, regulation, and supervision.

It is important to emphasize that all climate-related initiatives of financial sector supervisory authorities should be consistent with their respective core mandate. Actions of supervisors need to be consistent with their legal mandate. Prudential supervisors should focus on their core mandate of ensuring financial stability and promoting a safe and sound financial system; securities regulators on creating fair and transparent markets with adequate investor protection safeguards.

While financial supervisors should play an active role within their respective mandates to support the safe development of climate finance and enhance sound management of climate-related financial risks, regulation and supervision should not be used as substitutes for effective government policy on climate change. Rather, by focusing on their core mandates, supervisors can create a safer environment as an outcome, which will then boost climate investments.

Regulators and supervisors need to focus on building capacity within their organizations. Considering the enormous breadth and depth of the expertise required, the establishment of specialized solutions to build capacity is warranted. The capacity building efforts should be gradual and sustained and continuously evolve to reflect the international standards, methodologies, and practices that are still being developed. They need to connect interdisciplinary knowledge and, given the complex nature of climate-related topics, be able to capture the depth of the issues. These structures need to be inclusive for all functions of organizations, starting from the top.

The IMF is also increasing its capacity building efforts on climate and working together with regulators and supervisors in this context. The focus of IMF’s capacity building is currently primarily on the supervisor’s ability to assess climate risks through both multilateral and bilateral efforts. In 2021, a series of regional webinars were organized to raise awareness on climate-related financial risks, with participation of many authorities from emerging market and developing economies.

Virtual workshops on supervision of climate-related financial risk have also taken place in cooperation with the Chinese authorities, and with the IMF’s regional training centers in Africa—with plans to roll out such workshops in other regions. A climate risk module has also been added to the Fund’s online training framework in partnership with BIS’s Financial Stability Institute, which is available to all of the IMF’s membership. On the bilateral front, the Fund also provides climate-risk analysis technical assistance in order to build a framework to assess the risk of climate-related disasters on the banking sector.

This brings me to my last point: the role of the IMF in helping countries mobilize climate finance. Our lending tool, the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, or “RST,” now provides longer-term affordable financing for our vulnerable low- and middle-income members to reduce balance-of-payments risks associated with challenges such as climate change. Programs supported by the RST cover: (i) policy reforms; (ii) capacity development; and (iii) financing options to catalyze private capital. The RST was implemented in record time with 11 programs being approved within the first year, and twice that number is in the pipeline for next year. By supporting policy reforms, RST programs provide a critical complement to the largely project-based financing from MDBs and other donors. By removing policy barriers, it can also help catalyze additional financing from the private sector.

The IMF is using its convening power to bring together MDBs, IFIs, bilateral donors, private investors to help EMDEs explore new options for crowding in private climate finance—such as policy reforms, capacity development needs, and financing arrangements. In Bangladesh, Barbados, Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Rwanda, the governments have been able to catalyze the RST to crowd-in additional climate finance. And we are now working with additional RST-recipient countries to catalyze climate finance.

Let me conclude by reiterating that we must combine policy reforms, capacity development, and financing arrangements to scale-up climate finance. Financial sector supervisors can contribute to these efforts by closing data gaps and strengthening disclosures, incorporating climate considerations into prudential frameworks, and enhancing their capacity to conduct climate-risk analyses.

**46th Session of the IFAD Governing Council**  
**Opening Statement FAO Director-General, 14 February 2023**

Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Colleagues, I am pleased to address you today on behalf of FAO, and I thank my dear colleague, Alvario Lario, IFAD President, for this invitation. We are pleased to offer our services to IFAD, and to our Members, and to host the IFAD Governing Council here at FAO premises at headquarters - in the spirit of our close brotherhood and working together and supporting each other. There are many challenges we have to face together, and to achieve our shared goal of eradicating hunger and achieve our noble mandates together. Conflicts, the pandemic, climatic crises, economic slowdowns and downturns, and inequality continue to limit the quantity and quality of food that is available, accessible and affordable for all people, especially for the vulnerable.

The war in Ukraine has exacerbated food availability, food accessibility and food affordability casting a daunting shadow over global food security and food supply. It is critical that we tackle these global overlapping challenges in coordination with each other, and building on each other’s comparative advantages. Let me share a few thoughts on what is needed to bring about real change together. First: we need to increase responsible investments in agrifood systems and rural development. It is one of the most effective ways to reduce hunger and poverty, while safeguarding the planet. The FAO Strategic Framework 2022-31 sets out 20 Programme Priority Areas (PPAs), with one specifically dedicated to “Scaling up Investment”, which features close collaboration with International Financial Institutions such as the World Bank, IFAD and others.

Through FAO’s Investment Centre, we are bringing technical expertise to attract large-scale public investments in food and agriculture at large. Since 1977, when IFAD was created, our Investment Centre has assisted in preparing over 400 IFAD-funded projects in 160 countries, helping to leverage investments of almost USD 16.5 billion. Second: we need to harness the potential of innovation and technology. FAO’s new Science and Innovation Strategy will enable us to step up our efforts and address the urgent, complex and interlinked challenges facing our agrifood systems, by driving a new business model to help us deliver better.

In mid-October of 2022, we hosted the first Science and Innovation Forum, in the context of the annual World Food Forum – bringing together three key components(FAO, IFAD, WFP) for transformation of agrifood systems and rural development. Together with IFAD, we have successfully supported Members through a combination of finance with technical expertise. We have been working on building on existing and successful innovative solutions across both organizations. This includes block chain technology, automation and the use of artificial intelligence in agrifood systems, to help us deliver value added to our Members and ensure that no one is left behind – especially our farmers. FAO is also supporting IFAD in developing regional action plans for scaling up Digital Agriculture transformation in Latin America and the Caribbean, and developing projects in East Africa.

I just came back from Barbados where they expressed their appreciation for the good collaboration between the three U.N organizations in the region. Third: we must ensure that farmers at the core of all our work, and remain central to everything we do. Farmers contribute far more than just the food they produce. Family farmers, Indigenous Peoples, pastoralists, foresters and fishers are fundamental to efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems worldwide, and to ensure the 4 Betters: better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life for all.

Dear Colleagues, It is important to recognize the impact of our collective and coherent work, including increased support for small-scale producers. FAO has strengthened its commitment to ensure equitable access to natural resources, tenure rights, productive resources, information, technology, innovation, markets and decision-making processes. I am happy to share with you that FAO and IFAD are working more and more closely to act on this commitment. Through the Joint Secretariat for the UN Decade of Family Farming, we are coordinating actions for tangible impact on the ground. Under the umbrella of the Decade, we have contributed to the establishment of 12 National Action Plans, and three Regional Action Plans aimed at strengthening family farming.

Another key area of our collaboration is our joint work with Indigenous Peoples. During the 6th IFAD Forum on Indigenous Peoples held yesterday, the RBAs, Members, and indigenous leaders discussed ways to further strengthen and continue building on the work of the Coalition on Indigenous Peoples Food Systems, which was officially launched during the World Food Forum 2022 at the Boassu Nomadic tent that was set up on the premises here at FAO headquarters – a significant and historic event.

Dear Colleagues, A further important example of RBA collaboration includes our joint work on the Sahel Programme, where each of our agencies has contributed with its own comparative advantage to address the root causes of hunger, and strengthen the resilience of the most vulnerable, to ensure food security, nutrition and sustained peace. I can see first-hand how the collaboration between FAO and IFAD, together with WFP, continues to grow in strength, and is now more important than ever before. But there is still much to be done with only seven planting seasons left to achieve the 2030 Agenda, and support Members to speed up reaching the SDG targets.

We have to act now, efficiently, effectively, coherently and together. IFAD’s strategic vision and support are key for our successful collaboration and collective outcomes. I wish the IFAD Governing Council a successful meeting with effective guidance and engagement. Before closing, I wish to use this opportunity to convey our deepest condolences for the loss of life due to the devastating earthquake in Türkiye and Syria last week.

Thank you.

**3. “Healthy forests for healthy people” Dr QU Dongyu, FAO Director-General March 2023**

Good morning from Rome! Today we celebrate International Day of Forests 2023 as we face many challenges. The climate crisis is intensifying, and we are off track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. As we start to implement the Global Biodiversity Framework, biodiversity loss is threatening food security. Poverty, hunger and inequality persist, and we are off track to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. To meet our global goals, we need collective, efficient, coherent, rapid and impactful solutions – now! Forests provide many of the responses we need for this rapid and effective action.

Without healthy forests we do not have healthy people or a healthy planet. Forests are the source of food and nutrition for nearly 1 billion people. They tackle climate change by storing carbon, and contributing to adaptation and resilience, and they are the source of 50,000 plant species with healing properties. Today, FAO has a message about the Copaiba Tree, the indigenous trees of Latin America, which I got to know have special medicinal properties. We produce a lot of traditional medicines from herbs and trees. Not only in Latin America, but also in Europe, in Asia, in China, in India, and also in the Arab countries. Traditionally, we use a lot of the herbs and the trees for healing pain and for many traditional diseases, for which a long time ago our ancestors found the solutions. We still need a lot of research and technology to explore the full potential of trees and herbs for the future.

Trees also help prevent the spilling over of pathogens from animals to humans, which is a leading cause of emerging infectious diseases and contributors to pandemics. They mitigate air pollution and cool our cities, and are essential to sustainable cities. In short, forests are critical to human, animal, plant and ecosystem health, which are fundamental to our One Health approach. FAO has joined forces with the UN Environment Programme, the World Health Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health, under the Quadripartite. It is a key coordination mechanism, and next week we will have another meeting of the four Principals.

Dear Colleagues, It is clear that we need to prioritize our forests and agri-forestry if we are to effectively transform our agrifood systems, but the data shows that we are not treating forests with the respect they deserve. Between 2015 and 2020, we lost 10 million hectares of forests each year to deforestation, and climate change -driven wildfires and natural disasters are an increasing problem. We need to reverse this trend! We need to scale-up and accelerate action, now, and together.

We need strong commitments from governments, international organizations, the public and private sector, civil society, academia, and each of us individually.

We need to enhance forest restoration through sustainable forest management and restoration that provides benefits for people and the planet. FAO’s programme in support of Africa’s Great Green Wall initiative aims to support this key objective, as it tackles the social, economic and environmental impacts of land degradation and desertification across the driest areas of Africa by restoring the health of the land. We also need decision-makers to commit to improved policies. FAO’s Green Cities Initiative shows how city leaders can promote urban greening and sustainable urban and peri-urban food production.

Today, I am delighted that for the first time the Mayor of Turin is participating in our celebration, which is an indication that not only the public and private sectors, and central governments have a role to play, but also local governments and local communities. Since I started working with horticulture 40 years ago, I have seen how horticulture benefits the people that surround it. In 1992, when I was studying in Wageningen, I saw how in the Netherlands even small areas and villages look like flower gardens showing that horticulture and forestry are not only for the preservation of large things.

Apart from reducing carbon emissions and producing more fresh air, forestry and horticulture should also benefit the local people, and that is why everyone should get on board and contribute! And that is why the FAO Green Cities Initiative is so important – it is about more than just greening the cities and greening your environment, it is about building a new way of life. A new way forward for a green life and a green economy. For that reason, I welcome you, Mayor of Turin, and others, to join the FAO Green Cities Initiative, because such practices improve public health, food security and access to green spaces for healthier lifestyles.

We need to create a harmonized society, in harmony with nature, living together in harmony with plants and animals, but to achieve this we need financial commitment, and to widen access to appropriate financial resources and instruments. This means investing in agroforestry initiatives that create green jobs, improve livelihoods, increase food security and improve nutrition and restore ecosystems. It also means funding research and innovation, and sharing data, good practices, and evidence-based technologies, while also valuing the knowledge and traditions of Indigenous Peoples and local communities.Many Indigenous People are still living the mountains, in the primitive or secondary primitive forests, or even in some remote rehabilitated forests. For them it is their sky, it is their real home. It is different from living in the city.

Dear Friends of the Forests, Through a concerted global effort, we can reduce deforestation and forest degradation, improve forest resilience, and enhance the ecosystem that is important for people and the planet. Let’s make forests the fundamental value of our vision for more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable agrifood systems, because without agroforests it is not the world we want to design for our future. For a greener and healthier future with Better Production, Better Nutrition, a Better Environment and a Better Life for all – the Four Betters that depend on our forests and agroforests first. For a vivid future that leaves no one behind! Let’s work on this by planting trees – every day, every week, every year!

Thank you.

4. **Catalyst for Better Recovery and Resilience: Innovation and Digitization to Advance the Women, Peace and Security Agenda - Asako Okai Director, UNDP Crisis Bureau**

Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, On the occasion of the 67th Commission on the Status of Women, it is my great pleasure to welcome you all for our event which explores challenges and opportunities of innovation and digitalization to advance the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. Allow me to first thank our organizing partner and host, the Belgian Mission, along with our distinguished panelists for facilitating this important discussion.

We are now farther from achieving the goals of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda than ever before. In crisis contexts, threats to women and girls are spreading faster and becoming more insidious.

Digital tools are being used to fuel a system of exclusion and disinformation. We often see violent extremist groups using digital tools to profit from the subjugation of women and weaponize women’s desire to seek empowerment.

But today’s discussion is about turning this around. We know that if used correctly, digitalization can help enhance transparency and accountability, can help open services, amplify marginalized voices, and disrupt entrenched systems of power and patriarchy. Last year UNDP launched the 10 Point Action Agenda on Gender in Crisis as part of our Crisis Offer, a framework for development solutions in crisis and fragility. In it, our commitment to deliver on the Women Peace and Security Agenda takes center stage.

The 10 actions in the Agenda are based on our acute recognition that continued threats to women and other marginalized groups require cohesive interventions across various interconnected areas to address the deepest sources of patriarchal norms and institutions. We must seize the opportunities that crisis settings present, to reset systems, change mindsets and deliver sustained progress, rather than giving in to enormous challenges they also present. To address the root causes of inequality and disrupt the status quo, we must be more intentional in embracing innovation and technology such as digitalization, new financing, and science-based approaches to behavior change.

Our work begins where threats and disparities are severest. In Afghanistan, women are continuously expelled from the public sphere. Like our Afghan guest speaker who will speak about her work in coding shortly, we don’t give in. UNDP also continues to work with hundreds of Afghan women and has led businesses and enterprises to institute 200 women only market days in 3 provinces (Herat, Farah, Badghis) to reach 23,400 direct beneficiaries. In Somalia, UNDP supports the HANO Academy in advancing STEM. We will hear more about the STEM Initiative in Somalia from our panelist shortly.

In the same country, UNDP also introduced a methodology of behavioral science called Non-Violent Communication to address persistent issues related to gender justice. Through this approach, traditional leaders and women enhanced their capacity for empathetic connections in issues such as child marriage, female genital mutilation, and other discriminatory practices.

For the first time, in the targeted communities, the cases decreased. In Lebanon and Iraq, economic empowerment initiatives combined with responses to gender-based violence have provided safety at home and in the workplace. The use of behavioural science helped address power imbalances and created new avenues to employment, increasing female workforce retention by 40 percent.

In Yemen UNDP has worked with women and youth to train, develop and manage solar micro-grid businesses to help electrify their communities near war zones. Rural women launching technology-related business is remarkably rare and their new disposable income has given them a voice in community decision making.

Also in the panel shortly, you will hear from UNDP’s Communications Coordinator for Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE). Through our ExtremeLives project, UNDP has designed a digital advocacy platform using the power of personal testimonies to aggregate data and develop models for broader system change.

These initiatives are proving to be very effective and promising. However, I must say that in our own work across crisis settings, we still have a long way to go. These encouraging efforts must be scaled up and blended with more transformational approaches that drive necessary normative changes that advance women’s informed participation across decision-making platforms.

Distinguished participants, So far, the digital age has led to an age of disruption – with unequal results. We must ensure digitalization does not become yet another tool for advancing inequalities. It will take broader partnerships, innovative thinking, and above all, shared political will to address power imbalances. We can do this by ensuring digital strategies and National Actions Plans are interlinked to eliminate barriers and reflect priorities for women and girls.

By gender differentiating in our current and future engagements involving technology and innovation. By placing marginalized voices at the center of technological developments. Let us focus our efforts in the months and years to come, not on piecemeal approaches but on truly harnessing innovation and digitalization for transformative, joined-up action aimed at the most pervasive sources of inequality.

Thank you.

**5. The Path to Growth: Three Priorities for Action By Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director April 6, 2023**

Good morning—and thank you, Ambassador Holliday, for your warm welcome. Many thanks also to Politico for co-hosting today’s event, in the spirit of what our organizations stand for: bringing people together and fostering a better understanding of the global challenges we face. Being here in Meridian House—a beautiful ‘house on a hill’—reminds me of what Nelson Mandela once said: “I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb.”

This feels like the story of the past three years—climbing one “great hill” after another, only to discover there are many more to come. First was Covid, then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation and a cost-of-living crisis that hit everyone. So far, we have proven to be resilient climbers. But the path ahead—and especially the path back to robust growth—is rough and foggy, and the ropes that hold us together may be weaker now than they were just a few years ago.

Today, I want to talk about how we can navigate this difficult climb by focusing on the fundamental issue of growth: how we can secure a robust recovery in the short term, and lay the foundations for stronger, more sustainable, and more inclusive growth. Let me start with the economic landscape. After a strong recovery in 2021 came the severe shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine and its wide-ranging consequences—global growth in 2022 dropped by almost half, from 6.1 to 3.4 percent.

The slowdown has continued this year. Despite surprisingly resilient labor markets and consumer spending in most advanced economies, and the uplift from China’s reopening, we expect the world economy to grow less than 3 percent in 2023. As you will see in our World Economic Outlook next week, growth remains weak by historical comparison—both in the near and medium term. There are also stark differences between country groups. Some momentum comes from emerging economies—Asia especially is a bright spot. India and China are expected to account for half of global growth in 2023.

But others face a steeper climb. Economic activity is slowing in the United States and the Euro Area, where higher interest rates weigh on demand. About 90 percent of advanced economies are projected to see a decline in their growth rate this year. For low-income countries, higher borrowing costs come at a time of weakening demand for their exports. And we see their per-capita income growth staying below that of emerging economies. That is a severe blow, making it even harder for low-income nations to catch up.

Poverty and hunger could further increase, a dangerous trend that was started by the Covid crisis. Strong and coordinated monetary and fiscal policy actions over the past years prevented a much worse outcome. But with rising geopolitical tensions and still-high inflation, a robust recovery remains elusive. This harms the prospects of everyone, especially for the most vulnerable people and countries.

What would it take to brighten growth prospects over the short and medium term? I see three big hills we will have to climb. The first hill is fighting inflation and safeguarding financial stability. There cannot be robust growth without price stability—nor without financial stability. And these days, both need the attention of policymakers. Even as central banks have lifted interest rates at the fastest and most synchronized pace in decades, core inflation has remained stubbornly high—partly because of tight labor markets in many countries.

At the same time, fighting inflation has become more complex with the recent banking sector pressures in the United States and Switzerland—serving as a reminder of how difficult it is to transition rapidly from a prolonged period of low interest rates and ample liquidity to much higher rates and scarcer liquidity. They exposed risk management failures at specific banks, as well as supervisory lapses. But they have shown that the banking sector has come a long way since the 2008 global financial crisis.

Today, banks are generally stronger and more resilient, and policymakers have been remarkably swift and comprehensive in their actions in recent weeks. That said, concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also non-banks—now is not the time for complacency.

So, what does it mean for monetary policy? So long as financial pressures remain limited, we expect central banks to stay the course in the fight against inflation—holding a tight stance to prevent a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. At the same time, they should address financial stability risks when they emerge—through appropriate provision of liquidity. The key is to carefully monitor risks in banks and non-bank financial institutions, as well as weaknesses in sectors such as commercial real estate.

In other words, central banks should continue to use interest rates to fight inflation, while using financial policies to ensure financial stability. This is the right course of action so long as financial pressures remain limited. If that were to change, policymakers would face an even more complicated task, with difficult trade-offs between their inflation and financial stability objectives, and the use of their respective tools. That’s why they need to be more vigilant and more agile than ever.

On the fiscal side, further efforts to reduce budget deficits are critical to support the fight against inflation and create fiscal space to deal with future crises. But these efforts must be coupled with support for the most vulnerable, especially those still struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.

So, this is a difficult climb: tackle inflation, protect financial stability, and safeguard social cohesion. Getting it right brings the benefit of major advanced economies staying on the narrow path to a soft landing, and protecting the more vulnerable emerging and developing economies against harmful spillovers.

Let me move to the second hill: improving medium-term prospects for growth. We project global growth to remain around 3 percent over the next five years––our lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990, and well below the average of 3.8 percent from the past two decades. This makes it even harder to reduce poverty, heal the economic scars of the Covid crisis, and provide new and better opportunities for all.

Getting up this hill requires major step changes. One is to boost productivity and growth potential through structural reforms and by accelerating the digital revolution, improving the business environment, and boosting human capital and inclusion. Just closing the gap in women’s labor force participation could increase economic output by an average of 35 percent in countries with greater gender inequality.

We also need a ‘green step change’ to protect our planet and create new economic opportunities. Our collective goal of delivering on the Paris Agreement and boosting resilience will require redirecting trillions of dollars towards green projects. An estimated $1 trillion a year is needed for renewable energy alone. That will pay dividends in terms of growth and jobs.

Of course, we also need a step change in international cooperation to reduce the impact of economic fragmentation and geopolitical tension, especially over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This calamity not only kills innocent people; it also worsens the cost-of-living crisis and brings more hunger around the world. It risks wiping out the peace dividend we have enjoyed for the past three decades, adding also to frictions in trade and finance.

Our research shows that the long-term cost of trade fragmentation could be as high as 7 percent of global GDP—roughly equivalent to the combined annual output of Germany and Japan. If technological decoupling is added, some countries could see losses of up to 12 percent of GDP. And the fragmentation of capital flows, including foreign direct investment, would be another hit to the prospects for global growth. The combined losses from all channels may be hard to quantify, but it is clear they all head in the wrong direction.

It need not be this way. Countries can protect their economic and national security by continuing to trade and being pragmatic about strengthening supply chains. IMF research demonstrates that diversifying supply chains can cut in half potential economic losses from supply disruptions.

These step changes will be critical to make the global economy more vibrant, to create better opportunities for all. But for many vulnerable countries, they may not be achievable without extra help. This brings me to the third major ‘hill’ to climb—fostering solidarity to reduce global disparities.

Drawing on the strength of our collective, the IMF has provided nearly $300 billion in new financing for 96 countries since the start of the Covid pandemic. The historic SDR allocation of $650 billion helped to boost our member countries’ reserves. Our precautionary facilities provide an additional buffer to countries with strong economic fundamentals—most recently, we provided one for Morocco.

Through innovations in our toolkit—including the Food Shock Window, and the Resilience and Sustainability Trust—we are helping our members meet new challenges. We have also stepped up support for vulnerable middle-income countries—including through a temporary increase in the amount members can borrow from the IMF. And we have provided new financing to countries such as Sri Lanka and Ukraine.

This is precisely what the Fund is here to do: be a source of stability in turbulent times. Yet, for the weakest members of our global family, additional support from wealthier countries is essential. I would like to make a double plea on their behalf: help them handle the burden of debt, which was made so much harder by the shocks of the past years; and secondly, help ensure that the IMF continues to be in a position to support them in the years ahead.

Start with debt. About 15 percent of low-income countries are already in debt distress and another 45 percent face high debt vulnerabilities. And about a quarter of emerging economies are at high risk and facing “default-like” borrowing spreads. This has raised concerns over a potential wave of debt restructuring requests—and how to handle them at a time when current restructuring cases are facing costly delays, Zambia being the most recent example.

To help resolve this issue, the IMF, the World Bank, and India as G20 Chair, recently put in place a Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable. It brings together public and private creditors, as well as borrowers, to help reach consensus on standards and processes—so we can speed up restructuring cases, including those under the G20’s Common Framework.

But even as we call for progress on dealing with debt, we also need to bolster the IMF’s capacity to help our poorest member countries. To support them, we have increased our interest-free lending more than four-fold to $24 billion since the beginning of the pandemic. Now, we are urgently calling on our wealthier members to help address fundraising shortfalls in our Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust.

This is critical to ensure that the IMF can continue to provide vital support and help catalyze financing from others. So, too, is making sure that we can support all our members—so we are working this year to successfully complete the review of quotas, the building blocks of the IMF’s financial structure.

It is now more important than ever to step up cooperation—to strengthen the ropes that tie us together—on this issue and the full range of economic challenges we face. Only then can we climb these hills together.

This brings me back to the words of Nelson Mandela. On realizing that there are many more hills to climb, he said: “I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But...I dare not linger, for my long walk is not ended.”

The global community may also have a long walk ahead of us. But, as the Fund’s member countries gather for our Spring Meetings next week, we should stay laser-focused on the glorious vista of a future with stronger and more inclusive growth. Thank you.

**6. World Bank Managing Director Anna Bjerde’s Presentation to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Foreign Ministers - NOVEMBER 14, 2023**

The global economy is facing significant headwinds, especially with a continued upsurge of conflicts. In order for the World Bank to achieve our new mission, “To create a world free of poverty – on a livable planet,” we need peace and stability. We see increased fragmentation, both among advanced and developing economies, declining trade, and very weak investment. Rapid economic growth in developing APEC economies, especially in East Asia, has propelled unparalleled poverty reduction over the past decades.

Since 1990, the number of people living in extreme poverty ($2.15 per day, 2017) was reduced by over 1.3 billion. More than three quarters of those escaping extreme poverty were in the East Asia Pacific region. However, recent shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts, have had a profoundly negative effect on growth, both globally and in APEC economies. Higher debt levels, the unwinding of policy support, reduced consumer and investor confidence and a new wave of protectionism are contributing to lower growth – we estimate growth at 2.1% globally in 2023.

At the current pace of growth, the global economy is not on a path to eliminating extreme poverty nor to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. More worryingly, the recent shocks came at a time when deeper challenges to growth were already becoming apparent, even in developing East Asia, which has been the engine of the world’s growth and continues to outperform most regions.

Firstly, despite the emergence of new technologies, productivity growth is slowing down across emerging markets and developing countries – East Asia has not been immune. Secondly, the large young labor force was a key source of past economic growth. Working age populations are now shrinking in many countries, and nowhere faster than in East Asia, which risks growing old before it grows rich.

Thirdly, the slowdown is taking place in the context of global fragmentation. In 2022 alone, almost 3,000 new protectionist measures were imposed on global trade – three times more than in 2019 and a decade high. Lastly, and looming over all these factors is accelerating climate change. More than half of global losses from natural disasters already occur in East Asia and the Pacific and we estimate the impacts from climate change could exceed 10% of GDP in economies such as the Philippines or Vietnam by 2050.

In the current global economic context, there are no easy solutions to restore rapid economic growth. Instead, policy makers need to navigate a more difficult path of structural reforms to enhance foundations for stronger and more resilient, broad-based, and sustainable growth. Reforms, especially for the service sector, will play a particularly important role. Services already contribute more than manufacturing to productivity growth in major East Asian economies. Digitalization is boosting service productivity further.

Unleashing more growth in the service sector will require policies that improve regulation, enable competition, and facilitate investment and innovation, in particular in digitalization. The World Bank is supporting such reforms across the region, for example by expanding financial inclusion through digital finance in the Philippines, and by supporting financial sector reforms in Indonesia.

Yet nearly 3 billion people remain offline, primarily in developing countries. Broadband infrastructure is essential for digitalization. APEC economies will need to invest more in broadband networks in order to ensure that all businesses and households have access to high-speed internet and put special emphasis on the previously underserved and underrepresented communities.

The combination of services reform and digitalization will create new opportunities and enable firms and individuals to create new opportunities. For example, distance education and telemedicine supported by well-selected, trained, and motivated local staff have led to better learning and health outcomes in the region, though there remains significant inequality in access. To reap the full benefits of innovative, more service-oriented economies, we also need to invest more in people, especially the young, with better education and health systems.

Finally, to revitalize growth, countries ought to steer clear of a harmful cycle of trade restrictions and, instead, seek enhanced integration where feasible, while at the same time diversifying trading partners. This strategy of diversification has a direct implication for energy and transport linkages. We all need to work together to address climate change. APEC economies are already heavily affected by climate change but are also contributing to it.

East Asia and the Pacific accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions and 60 percent of the world’s coal consumption. This means investing in clean energy and electrification at scale, enhancing energy efficiency, avoiding new coal plant construction while accelerating the retirement of old coal plants. The green transition presents a wide range of innovation opportunities that can become the region’s new growth drivers if leveraged effectively.

Adaptation should also remain a priority given region’s exposure to natural disasters, including extreme weather events related to climate change, especially for the small Pacific Island economies. The World Bank is committed to supporting APEC economies. We have numerous programs that are aimed at supporting the economic policies implemented by country authorities, and projects designed to improve peoples’ livelihoods. We have put a strong emphasis on climate action in many of our operations. In East Asia and the Pacific, 46 percent of new World Bank commitments in fiscal year 2022 contributed to climate action.

Some of the Bank’s most innovative solutions have been first piloted across APEC economies. We tested Emission Reduction-Linked Bonds in Vietnam. In Indonesia, the Bank is supporting government’s National Mangrove Rehabilitation Program. The project aims to enhance the management of mangroves and the livelihoods of local communities in selected coastal areas. In the Philippines, one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, the World Bank has supported disaster recovery systems and resilience.

This included catastrophe bonds, contingent financing for disaster response, local government catastrophe risk insurance programs and national indemnity insurance, as well as interventions to strengthen infrastructure and flood management. We’re also working with Peru to support reforms to promote greener production, private investments in sustainable commercial forest plantations, and climate-smart agriculture; and with Mexico to mitigate the loss of forests’ carbon storage capacity.

In Chile, the Bank is supporting the development of the Green Hydrogen Facility (GHF) as a risk-sharing mechanism to mobilize commercial financing and to achieve fair and sustainable socio-economic development with local communities.  In Peru, the World Bank is supporting the strengthening of the public health emergency preparedness and response. Today’s development challenges are daunting and global in nature. However, at the World Bank, we remain optimistic that the right policy solutions and investments can revitalize growth, revive poverty reduction, and increase resilience against future shocks.

Internally, we are working on transforming the World Bank to better support countries to tackle global challenges. We are improving our operational model, for more speed and scale. And given the recurrent crises, we are expanding our toolkit for crisis preparedness, response, and recovery. This includes Climate Resilient Debt Clauses for small states to temporarily pause repayments in case of a severe natural disaster, and rapid access to resources for emergency response. We are also working on enhanced disaster risk financing instruments.

We look forward to continuing working with APEC economies toward a sustainable, equitable, and inclusive future for all.

**Science for advanced economic development - Thursday, 30 March 2023**

Thank you for inviting me today. I’d first like to acknowledge the Turrbal and the Jagera peoples, the traditional custodians of the lands on which we meet today. I’m honoured to be here with such a great and varied audience of leaders across many sectors. I’m looking forward to this being a two-way exchange, so I can benefit from the knowledge and ideas in this room. And thank you for your focus on science. It won’t have escaped your attention that, as far as I’m concerned, science and research are quite simply fundamental to Australia’s future. They are the drivers of our future prosperity. They are the drivers of innovation and employment. They are key to revitalising our regions, reshaping our cities and protecting what’s unique in the environment around us.

Science is humanity’s superpower, and we’re here because we’ve been able to use that superpower to create the modern world. DNA analysis here in Australia tells us that the natural lifespan of humans may be just 38 years. So if you’ve tipped 40, you’re here because of science. If you arrived by air, if you or your family took medication this morning, or you checked the weather forecast, listened to the radio, checked your bank account – it’s because of science. All of us benefit from science at this day-to-day level. We understand almost intuitively where science has impacted our lives for the better.

We trust in its power. Now, we need to back it in at a much bigger scale – understand that the transformations and benefits that science has brought to all of our lives are transformations it can also bring to the life of our nation. Addressing climate change will drive innovation, jobs and prosperity, and unlock new technological capabilities. The same can be said for new ways of protecting against and responding to wildfires and weather extremes, for new forms of protein, new techniques for medical diagnosis, and more finely tuned personalised medicine.

These things will happen, and they will happen regardless of you and me, but our aim here in Australia is not simply to wait for the trickle down. Our aim is to be ambitious – to reap the benefits of this moment to transform our economy. If we can successfully focus our efforts, there’s a great future on offer: a future where Australia is a central part of high-tech supply chains, including in semi-conductors and batteries; where we are an exporter of clean hydrogen, in no small part due to the work of my predecessor, Alan Finkel; where Australia not only mines but processes the critical minerals that are in such high demand; where we grow our capability in high-tech manufacturing including pharmaceuticals.

Today, I want to tell you about some of the work I have underway in pursuit of this agenda. Also, I want to hear from you about how to make the most of the opportunities in front of us – but first, let’s take a step back. As you know, I’m in the middle of a national conversation on behalf of the government to develop a new set of national science and research priorities. Since I began this conversation three weeks ago, I’ve held 22 roundtables with peak bodies, industry groups, science and research sectors, and community groups. I’ve travelled to regional NSW, Western Australia, Victoria, and now I’m in Queensland – and very happy to be here. Yesterday, I was in Townsville, and I have a number of meetings here in Brisbane, before Darwin on Monday.

So it’s quite the tour! And you might be wondering why. Why am I criss-crossing the country to meet with so many Australians when many things about the science agenda are already clear? The answer is that the Government wants to engage people across the sector, from the research community to leaders such as yourselves, to build a community view about what we can work on together. The Minister has made it clear that he wants to back Australian ideas, so they can grow here. Before I became Australia’s Chief Scientist, I worked at the interface between research and commercialisation at the CSIRO – identifying commercial opportunities, and leading projects along that road from lab to application. I learned that the first step is to strip it all back and understand your problem – what do we want to achieve?

This is why, as I tour the country to hear from people such as yourselves, the questions I’m asking on behalf of the Government are: What are the big challenges that science can help address? What are the opportunities and where are our strengths? Because once we better understand the answers to those questions, we’re in a better position to chart the steps forward and come together to concentrate our efforts. You probably heard the UN Secretary General refer this week to the need for climate action on all fronts – “everything, everywhere, all at once”. As he says, efforts to tackle climate change must encompass all of our energy needs, across all aspects of the economy, and across all countries. But here in Australia, we need to bring that broad ambition to an approach that is targeted and strategic. A scattergun approach will fail – because we simply don’t have the scale in our economy or in our workforce to do everything.

This is why the Government wants to develop national science priorities that are both ambitious and purpose-driven. This is not about a popularity contest – most votes wins. We don’t want to end up with Boaty McBoatface. Nor is it about covering every aspect of Australian research or research funding. That’s not the aim. The aim is a coherent, focused set of priorities. A set of priorities that will send a clear signal to industry and investors, to our international partners, and to the research community, to say: these are the areas where Australia needs a collective focus, where we need to double down to be the nation we aspire to be; these are the science priorities that will help shape a prosperous and sustainable economy and a healthy community.

One of the things that’s clear as we develop the priorities is that many of the challenges we face have cascading impacts on each other. And likewise, the solutions are integrated and multidisciplinary. The clean energy agenda is inseparable from high-tech manufacturing – for example, to manufacture green steel, or process critical minerals further up the value chain for use in batteries or electric vehicles. The advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and quantum technologies are inseparable from Australia’s strategic imperatives – the submarine project and also to our supply chain ambitions in areas such as semiconductor design.

These same advances in digital capabilities will transform medicine and climate modelling. There are great synergies in technology across these sectors – and those great synergies create a great responsibility on all of us to show up to the party. None of us can do it alone. We need to work across sectors and across disciplines. We need to work beyond the traditional STEM subjects to the social sciences, and beyond research to the industrial frontline.

The critical minerals opportunity is a good example of the need for focused and collaborative effort. Australia is richly endowed, as you know. We have significant deposits of many of the critical minerals for the energy transition, including one of the world’s biggest lithium reserves, needed for advanced batteries. This is matched by huge projected global demand.

The Future Battery Industries CRC calculated this week that battery manufacture could be worth $17 billion to the economy by the end of the decade. Abundant mineral deposits, on the one hand, and huge demand on the other is a great place to be. But of course, a lot has to happen in the middle. In the middle is extraction and processing, and this is where that unified, strategic approach is required.

As those of you in this sector will know, critical minerals processing is a challenge for Australia. We have good science, but we strike trouble when it comes to critical mass and IP. We’re spread too thin. And very little of the intellectual property is held here in Australia.

These are challenges that can only be overcome with that integrated, multidisciplinary approach: deciding which of the critical minerals opportunities we’re best placed to pursue; where we can value-add to best effect, and how we can scale up; developing new business models that are clear-eyed about the context we’re operating in – the energy transition and our supply chain ambitions with partner countries; business models that focus on low emissions extraction and build in recycling and reuse – that take account of the entire lifecycle of the minerals.

Of course, this doesn’t apply only to critical minerals. Matching strengths to opportunities, and scaling up in a coordinated way across science, industry and government, is a task across the economy. It’s a task that requires buy-in from all sectors. So the Government wants to see a collaborative, strategic focus. I have another personal perspective I want to share with you today. It is about the nature of research – because I think this is where the interface between business and science, and between government and science, can sometimes become unstuck.

The important thing to understand about research is that it takes patient investment over the long term. It’s not ‘fill the kettle, flick the switch and 20 seconds later you have steam’. In the process of discovery, not every idea will lead to a successful outcome. For some ideas, the pay-off will be unexpected, or even in a different field altogether. Not every flick of the switch will create steam.

Thank you very much.

**The Secretary-General Ban’s Remarks at The Summit on Science and Technology Enablement for The Sustainable Development Goals - New York, 29 November 2016**

I am grateful to the New York Academy of Sciences for bringing us together to support the Sustainable Development Goals.

The United Nations attaches great importance to its partnership with the scientific community. You have been with us since both the United Nations and UNESCO were founded in 1945.

I have worked to strengthen that bond throughout my tenure, including by establishing a Scientific Advisory Board. Science has transformative power, and we need those contributions more than ever.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is our shared plan for the future — our manifesto for advancing human progress in harmony with our planet.

A great many governments are now making the 17 Sustainable Development Goals part of their national development planning. More businesses are incorporating sustainability into their operations and investments.

Today I would like to offer ten ways in which I hope the scientific community will be an even bigger part of this effort.

First, I ask you to truly embrace the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change.

Let us not be daunted by the ambition contained in these agreements. Scientists are quite at home with big goals and new ways of thinking. That is how they have helped to cure diseases and send men to the moon. And that is how we will fulfil our moral imperative to bring about a safer and more just world.

Second, we need science to help us learn what works, and what does not, from health to agriculture and across all the Goals. Moreover, we need you to help us to better understand the links among the Goals.

Third, we need science to continue providing the evidence to guide our response to climate change. The Paris Agreement has entered into force — a great diplomatic victory but also an important achievement for the scientists who spent decades warning about the threat.

Going forward, and in keeping with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, scientists are already telling us we have to get on an emissions pathway that limits warming this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius – and as low as 1.5 degrees.

Science will thus have a major voice as we use the review mechanisms of the Paris Agreement to raise ambition. We also need your innovations and climate-friendly solutions to help further reduce the costs of renewable energy.

Fourth, we need your contributions for the Global Sustainable Development Report, which is to be issued every four years. National academies of science will have a critical role in mobilizing scientists around this report, which will be a vital instrument for consolidating and presenting scientific knowledge, influencing policy and accelerating our efforts.

Fifth, I encourage you to support the UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism, which aims to improve access to technology in many fields.

Sixth, scientists can help us address other inequalities, not just the technology gap. We are all aware of the need for more research into neglected tropical diseases, and for a green revolution in Africa. All countries deserve to benefit from the fruits of scientific endeavour.

Seventh, I call on you to help us to seize the remarkable potential of the data revolution. The United Nations has tried to keep pace, including through the Global Pulse initiative. Please join us in South Africa in January 2017 for the first-ever UN World Data Forum.

Eighth, we need you to do your part for women’s empowerment. I am pleased to note that there are more women than men on the UN Scientific Advisory Board. But women still make up less than 30 per cent of the world’s researchers. What a waste of brain power!

Ninth, we should also do more to bring young people into the sciences. I commend the New York Academy of Science for its Global STEM Alliance for Scientific, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education. Let us take the fear out of science!

Tenth and finally, at a time when extremist groups and even many politicians are striving to push people into camps of “us” and “them”, the scientific community can be an example of problem-solving across the lines that might otherwise divide.

The most vulnerable members of the human family depend on you to empower them to break out of the cycles of poverty.

People everywhere are looking to you to help us build resilience in the face of climate change. Entrepreneurs and innovators depend on your groundbreaking research to bring sustainable solutions to the market.

City planners and infrastructure developers are hungry for your help in building livable urban environments. All of this will mean doing what you do best — producing valuable findings and academic outputs. But even more than that, it will mean going the extra mile to help apply and communicate the science.

This is a time of turmoil and conflict. The number of people who require humanitarian assistance is the largest in UN history. More than 65 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes – more than at any time since the Second World War.

Yet I continue to believe that this is also an era of remarkable opportunity. Let us work together so that science can do its best for humankind. Thank you for your commitment to our shared goals.

**Conference: Thinking about Industrial Property, Sustainability and the Future of the Plane. WIPO Director General Daren Tang’s Opening Remarks**

**Lisbon, May 29, 2023**

It is a great pleasure to be back in the historic city of Lisbon and at this important conference. I am deeply grateful to the Portuguese government for their support of this initiative ahead of the UN SDG Summit in September. Twelve months ago, Lisbon played host to a meeting of the Lusophone Commonwealth with WIPO to open a new chapter of our relationship. On that occasion, I shared WIPO’s new vision, that IP could and should be a powerful catalyst for growth and development in a community spanning four continents and over 300 million people.

I return to Lisbon today to reinforce and amplify this message not just for the Lusophone community, but for the whole world. Solving the greatest global challenges of our time requires that we harness the energy of innovation and the power of creativity in the service of humankind. I am honored that Prime Minister Costa, joined by many senior political and government leaders, is using this conference to underscore Portugal’s commitment to shaping the global IP ecosystem so that it can be in the service of the SDGs.

Already, IP protects those taking risks in areas such as clean-tech and green-tech to create new ideas. It provides a vehicle for lifesaving medicines and breakthrough technologies to get to market. It helps research across the life sciences to create impact. And it is a means for distributing groundbreaking discoveries to places where they are needed the most. Because of the pandemic and other crises, progress on the SDGs has either stalled or gone into reverse in over 30 percent of the goals, with an extra 75 million people living in extreme poverty today than before the pandemic.

To step up effectively, we must do so as an international community. And of course, to quote again, the Deputy Secretary-General, the great challenges that we face: ending poverty and hunger, tackling climate change and addressing humanitarian and health emergencies – are common to us all. However, when it comes to IP and the SDGs we sometimes encounter the perception that IP is an obstacle to our common goal of delivering a fairer, better and more sustainable world.

Our belief is that IP is part of the solution to our common global challenges, and that it can be a powerful catalyst for growth and development, as well as an important tool for translating great ideas into impact that will help us meet the SDGs and leave no-one behind. This link is enshrined within SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. But IP’s role in delivering Agenda 2030 goes beyond this vertical and is in fact a horizontal that cuts across all SDGs, fueling the innovative solutions that can be deployed in addressing all 17 SDGs.

But to show this, the global IP community needs to work hard to deliver results and action. That’s why we have fully integrated the SDG’s across the breadth of our work at WIPO, so that they serve as a frame for building a more inclusive IP ecosystem – one much closer and connected to people, businesses and communities in all parts of the world.

Let me share four concrete examples. First, on SDG 13: Climate Action.

Despite the volume of green technologies in development, their adoption and diffusion can struggle to keep pace with the scale and urgency of the climate threat. WIPO GREEN, our online and global platform for climate-tech exchange, bridges this gap by connecting providers and seekers of green technologies around the world. Not only does this lead to tangible partnerships on the ground, it ensures that technology adoption matches local needs.

WIPO GREEN has grown strongly in recent years to cover more than 130,000 technologies from over 140 countries, and we believe it is the biggest and most sophisticated green tech platform that the UN family offers today. Now, our objective is to increase the number of successful matches. One way of doing this is to continue to raise awareness of the platform. At COP 27, we launched the Green Technology Book, which showcases some of the technologies available in the critical field of climate adaptation. It has been accessed over half a million times in just six months, with most views coming from developing countries.

We will also continue to invest in WIPO GREEN’s Acceleration Projects(to address climate change, food security and environmental challenges by identifying pressing needs and facilitating connections with innovative green technology solutions in focus areas). These are helping to advance climate-smart agriculture in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru; to boost energy efficiency in China; and to support the greening of palm oil production in Indonesia. We are open to further partnerships nationally, regionally and with the private sector.

Second, on SDG 5: Gender Equality.

The Deputy Secretary General has mentioned this quite a bit, and to reinforce her point, Portugal has the highest number of women in science and tech in the European region. So, congratulations to the Portuguese government and people on this achievement. To address global challenges, all sectors of society must be supported to realize their innovative and creative potential. But right now, the gap is big. Despite progress in recent years, women file only 16 percent of international patent applications.

Urgent change is needed. To help deliver it, we are taking forward IPGAP – WIPO’s Gender Action Plan. Lisa Jorgensen, WIPO’s Deputy Director General in charge of the Patents and Technology Sector and our first IP and Gender champion, will have more to say about this in today’s discussions. But let me focus on one aspect: how we are supporting women’s economic empowerment at the grassroots level.

Over the past year, WIPO has launched bespoke projects for women entrepreneurs in Jordan, Egypt, Namibia and Uganda, as well as in groups of Latin American and Central European and Baltic states. These are not one-off seminars or events but months-long mentorship programs that are designed to understand the journey of these women, their challenges, and help them incorporate IP as part of their journey.

We are helping women with no prior IP background in China, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam to manage their IP. We are pioneering an initiative for Women in STEM careers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Peru. Our training, mentoring and matching program for women entrepreneurs from indigenous communities has supported close to 100 people from over 50 countries. And last month’s World IP Day, which was centered on the theme of “IP and Women,” was not only a celebration of women inventors and creators, but a chance to build momentum behind further and faster change for the benefit of current and future generations.

Third, SDG 4: Quality Education.

The WIPO Academy is the world’s largest provider of IP training and skills, offering over 300 courses that reached more than 270,000 people over the past two years – nearly 200,000 of whom are from Asia, Latin America and Africa. These training courses are helping to level up the skillsets of many of those from developing countries and LDCs who are innovating at the grassroots level.

To maximize impact, we have broadened the work of the WIPO Academy, introducing courses such as IP for exports and IP for startups, IP for mobile app developers, which go beyond transfers of technical IP knowledge to the building of practical IP skills. This has helped us to provide IP training to over 50,000 small and medium enterprises over the past two years, and increase the number of people from developing countries graduating from our Master’s degree programs.

I also want to highlight the vital work of the Marrakesh Treaty and WIPO’s Accessible Books Consortium. The Marrakesh Treaty supports millions of people who are blind or visually impaired around the world by widening access to specially adapted books. ABC’s Global Book Service delivered nearly 150,000 titles to people who are print-disabled last year – creating new opportunities for inclusive learning and career development in all regions of the world.

And fourth, SDG 17: Partnerships.

One of the most powerful lessons of the pandemic was that the global response was strongest when parties pulled together: when scientists collaborated across borders; when countries helped one another to get jabs into arms; when international organizations pooled their expertise. One of the early steps we took was to strengthen our trilateral cooperation with the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization. We knew that by working across all three agencies, and by drawing on our respective know-how in innovation, health and trade, we could enhance the assistance available to Member States, and add to the support offered by our own COVID-19 response package.

WIPO has also just completed our first full year as a member of the UN Sustainable Development Group. We are confident that this will open the door to new and exciting collaborations with other UN agencies and partners around the world. And we have published a new report identifying examples of good practice among IP offices in support of the SDGs. Now, we are eager for this momentum to flow across the full spectrum of our work.

Whether we are addressing questions around IP and AI, or finding new ways to ensure that IP works for all, supporting the 2030 Agenda will continue to be front and center of everything that we do. In conclusion, with the SDGs hanging in the balance, this is a time for leadership, a time for action, and a time for the IP community to step up its contribution to the goals.

To lead that charge, I am pleased to announce that IP and the SDGs will be theme of World IP Day in 2024, which we celebrate on 26th April each year. As WIPO's flagship campaign to galvanize action across all our 193 Member States, the theme of IP and SDGs will hopefully focus all of our attention on this important topic.

Lastly, as the global IP community and the UN family, it is critical that we bring together all of our efforts to bring the SDGs back on track and harness the power of innovation and creativity from around the world so that together we can use IP to help build a better, fairer and more sustainable world. WIPO stands ready to be your partner on this journey and wishes the participants a fruitful, impactful and exciting discussion.

Thank you very much. Muito obrigado.

**HLPF Webinar Side event - Digital with Purpose: Accelerating action and transformative pathways for delivering on the sustainable development goals and recovery from COVID-19 Pandemic. 8 July 2020 - Virtual Meeting**

Excellencies, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to you wherever you happen to be. Thank you for joining us for this HLPF side event on Digital with Purpose: Accelerating action and transformative pathways for delivering on the sustainable development goals and recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic.

ITU is very pleased to co-organise this event with GeSI and the UN Office for South-South Cooperation. Mr Jorge Chediek was kind enough to host a side event for us during last year’s HLPF at the UNOSSC office in New York and so we are pleased to continue this collaboration. Hopefully we will be able to meet physically next year but one advantage of these virtual events is that participants can join from around the world at no cost so they are more accessible and inclusive than physical events.

ITU has a long history of collaboration with GeSI, we have organised many joint events in New York and around the world and I am sure you will be very impressed with the presentation of the Digital with Purpose initiative that the GeSI CEO Luis Neves will present shortly.

We are very grateful to the ambassadors of Montenegro and Bangladesh for their welcome remarks at this event and the Hon. Minister from Niger, who is doing such great work in his country to connect schools and villages, to join the panel with another excellent example of what can be achieved by ICTs given by Argentina’s Under Secretary for ICTs Mr Martin Olmos.

The COVID-19 crisis has illustrated the power and promise of information and communication technologies (ICTs) as never before. Never has there been so much reliance, appreciation and emphasis placed on the important role and capacity of ICTs. During lockdown, ICTs have given billions of people around the world the ability to continue their work, studies, care of others and remain connected to loved ones. We must give credit to the network operators and platform providers that have been able to respond successfully to the huge increase in demand over the past few months. It has been an incredible demonstration of the resilience of this digital technology.

But of course not all have been able to benefit. Let’s remember that 3.6 billion people around the world are still not connected to the Internet, mostly those living in rural areas and remote communities, which is why our collaboration with UNOSSC is very welcome.

However, I believe that the increased recognition of the importance of being connected, as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, will hopefully make it sooner ratherthan later that everyone, everywhere is connected. It is now clear that leveraging ICTs to connect everyone everywhere, will be essential to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the fundamental importance of ICTs to economies and societies everywhere – from fighting the spread of the virus through continued access to healthcare, teleworking, remote-schooling and access to essential goods and services, and keeping family and friends connected. With COVID-19 nobody will be safe until everyone is safe.

International collaboration, cooperation and coordination between all stakeholders, public and private, is essential to fight this virus. And such collaboration will also be necessary to deliver the sustainable development agenda. Only when we all work together, bringing our own specific competencies to the table and avoiding duplication of effort and pooling our resources for the common good will we succeed.

It is at times like these that we need to ensure that the digital infrastructure, services, and applications that have proved fundamental in this crisis are beneficial to all, so that we leave no one behind as we recover from the pandemic.

ITU is fortunate to have a diverse membership of over 900 sector members, mostly private sector companies in the telecommunications and Internet sectors, along with our 193 Member States. We are committed to working with our membership and many other organisations to leverage ICTs to help defeat COVID-19 and accelerate progress in the attainment of the sustainable development goals.

As an optimist, let me conclude by saying I believe some good will come from this Covid-19 experience. It has brought home to everyone the tremendous benefits of digital technologies to transform our economies and our lives for the better and create a more sustainable world. We don’t have to commute to our office every day, we don’t have to travel the world for a business meeting. We can be efficient and effective working from home, and at the same time benefit from a better work life balance.

Digital technologies with purpose are absolutely vital to meet our ambitious evelopment targets. Collaboration and cooperation are key. No single entity can do it alone. All stakeholders: government, civil society, academia, the UN system and the ICT community need to rise to the challenge and strengthen the collective digital response to these unprecedented challenges, so as to promote the sustainable development of society, the environment and economies. Thank you.

**Keynote Address to the London Business School: “AI for Sustainable Development”**

**Remarks by Angel Gurría OECD Secretary-General**

**9 September 2020 - London, UK**

Dear Dean, Professor Chandy, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Thank you for your warm welcome. I would like to thank Professor Papaioannou and the Wheeler Institute for hosting today’s conversation on Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Development – a topic at the heart of the OECD’s policy agenda.

Fifty years ago, the world watched in awe as the first humans landed on the moon. This remains one of the greatest feats of science, technology and innovation, and is a testament to the incredible power of human ingenuity, intelligence and courage.

Today, Artificial Intelligence – AI – is helping us to build on this achievement, by giving us the power to map the moon, to locate and count craters, and even to (virtually) moonwalk! In the not-too-distant future, AI is likely to propel us even further, to new frontiers in space.

Here on earth, AI has the potential to catalyse remarkable progress in our education, health, transport, social protection, communication and energy systems. It can also help us meet our global ambitions, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement.

But AI is also fuelling anxieties and ethical concerns. Many fear that it will facilitate automated discrimination, by codifying existing biases from the analogue world into the digital world, including those related to gender, race or even the justice system.

To realise the full potential of this promising technology, we need one critical ingredient – trust. And to build trust, we need human-centred AI that fosters sustainable development and inclusive human progress. Allow me to highlight a few priorities.

First, we must seize AI’s potential for productivity and scientific advances. AI holds significant potential to drive productivity gains. It is helping people make better predictions and decisions, be they a doctor, a shop-floor manager or a farmer in the field. AI start ups attracted over 12% of all worldwide private equity investments in the first half of 2018, reflecting this economic potential.

AI can also increase the productivity of science. This is particularly relevant at a time when we face significant global challenges – a persistently sluggish global economy, growing trade tensions, climate change, and ageing societies, to name a few.

More than a decade ago at a laboratory in Wales, a robot named Adam became the first machine to discover new scientific knowledge independently – a compound that works against a drug-resistant parasite that causes malaria.

But such advances are not automatic; significant complementary investments are needed to support them. Many firms do not even use relatively basic digital technologies, let alone AI.

In fact, OECD analysis shows that only 11% of small firms perform big data analysis. Meanwhile, the growing prominence of AI in science is raising important policy questions around access to data and high-performance computing, intellectual property, and education.

Second, we must prepare for the transformation of the labour market and build skills. For workers, technological change presents great opportunities. It can improve flexibility, productivity and earnings; and it can also reduce exposure to dangerous, unhealthy and tedious tasks.

But there are also risks. Across OECD countries, on average, around 14% of jobs are at a high risk of automation in the next 10 to 15 years, and a further 32% have a significant risk of disruption. AI will change, and perhaps accelerate, the profile of tasks that may be automated.

Exploratory work suggested that, in 2017, only 13% of OECD adults used, on a daily basis, literacy, numeracy and problem solving skills with higher proficiency than computers.

There are also risks of increasing inequalities. In a rapidly changing world, lifelong learning is an imperative for everyone, particularly low-skilled workers. They face a higher risk of job automation, and on average are 40 percentage points less likely to participate in adult learning than high-skilled workers in OECD countries.

To face such challenges, we must prepare and protect future generations. The OECD’s Learning Compass for 2030 outlines the need to adapt education so that our children become digitally aware citizens.

This means going beyond literacy and numeracy, and fostering data and digital literacy. But having technical expertise and training a new generation of data scientists and digital experts is not enough. It will also be crucial to teach them social and emotional skills, as well as a sense of responsibility and ethics.

Third, we need to put AI at the service of the environment. AI can accelerate the transition to a circular economy, reducing environmental pressures and the risks of raw material supply shocks. In fact, AI can help improve industrial production by making physical assets more intelligent and boosting data driven decision-making.

This will enhance predictive maintenance, helping firms to extend product life, minimise waste, and optimise the performance of their systems and processes. AI is also spurring innovative environmental policy approaches. For example, the UK Government is working with industry to develop an electronic waste tracking system that records all waste movements through the economy.

The system focuses on boosting compliance, and reducing waste crime, by detecting illegal dumping and landfill avoidance. However, the digitalisation of the circular economy can also have unintended environmental consequences. Rebound effects by increased levels of production and consumption of circular activities or lagging regulation are two examples of risks that require careful management.

The OECD is setting a course for human-centred AI.

The OECD recognises that actions at the margin will not be enough to harness AI for sustainable development. We need a comprehensive approach. In May, we launched the OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence to promote the responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI.

This Recommendation – which represents the first-ever set of intergovernmental principles on AI – includes technical definitions, principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI (including human-centred values and fairness, transparency and explainability, robustness and accountability), recommendations for national policies on trustworthy AI and advice for international cooperation.

Last July, in Osaka, G20 Leaders endorsed the G20 AI Principles, which are largely drawn from the OECD Recommendation on AI. We will continue to advance multi-stakeholder collaboration on AI, with the launch of the OECD AI Policy Observatory later this year.

This initiative will facilitate the development of evidence and practical guidance for policymakers and act as a hub for OECD work on AI, focusing on the interplay between AI and productivity, jobs, skills and trust.

The OECD is also working hard to address labour market challenges. The OECD’s 2019 Employment Outlook and our 2019 Skills Outlook put forward a Transition Agenda for a Future That Works For All. This calls for strengthening lifelong learning, social protection and collective bargaining – while targeting interventions on those who need it the most.

Ladies and Gentlemen: Masayoshi Son, the founder of Soft Bank, said of AI, “If we misuse it, it’s a risk. If we use it in good spirits, it will be our partner for a better life.”

We must harness the efficiency and intelligence of AI to build a better world where growth is inherently sustainable, inclusive and beneficial to all. Let’s give people the tools to succeed in the world of tomorrow, let’s use this potential to protect our planet, and let’s harness progress and innovation, to make it people-centred.

The OECD looks forward to strengthening our engagement with the London Business School, as we work together to design, develop and deliver better AI policies for better lives. Thank you.

**Simon Stiell & Dr. Sultan Al Jaber: Leadership by the G20 is Indispensable**  
**27 July 2023**

Dear colleagues, With only 125 days to go, we must use every opportunity between now and COP28 to align action and political will going forward towards the common goal of closing the gaps across all of the pillars of the Paris Agreement and get on track to keep 1.5⁰C within reach. The G20 is responsible for 85% of the world’s GDP, but also 80% of the world’s emissions.

Leadership by the G20 is indispensable to enable an inclusive and ambitious development agenda that demonstrates to the world that the transformation towards a net-zero and climate resilient world comes with great benefits for growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development.

While the discussions at the G20 Energy Ministerial considered energy transition and aligning current pathways with the Paris Goals, the outcome did not provide a sufficiently clear signal for transforming global energy systems, scaling up renewable and clean energy sources and responsibly phasing down fossil fuels. This year, more than ever, unity is a prerequisite for success. Globally, the world has experienced its hottest summer on record, climate change continues to impact people every day, particularly the climate vulnerable, and they are looking to us to take decisive action.

The signal we send for the conclusion of the first ever Global Stocktake(GST이행점검) at COP28 will be crucial. This can not only look backwards, but should also set out a collective pathway going forward. A commitment to more ambitious action, across all pillars of the Paris Agreement, is needed to ensure a credible response to the GST and to strengthen the integrity of the multilateral process under the UNFCCC(유엔기후변화협약) as a whole.

The science demands a strong mitigation outcome at COP28 that drives a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and builds on the progress of previous COPs. We call on the G20 to lead the way on the basis of both science and equity, laying the path to a strong and credible outcome that provides developing countries with the basis to undertake a just transition.

Together, we must take necessary steps to accelerate our inevitable decarbonization in a responsible manner, while enabling energy access for all, promoting sustainable development and supporting just transition. Tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvements across sectors by 2030, including ramping up electrification and enhanced cooling approaches, is critical to enable this. We must not only address supply, but also demand, in particular transforming heavy emitting sectors.

It is our hope that any progress achieved by the G20 drives strong outcomes at COP28 under the Global Stocktake and capitalizes on the Just Transition Work Programme established at COP27 to ensure that this transition is fair, leaves no one behind and supports the broad development challenges faced by developing countries in launching this transition, which should address the transformations needed under both the mitigation and adaptation agendas.

A credible response should be underpinned by clear and tangible outcomes on adaptation, where the impacts on lives and livelihoods demand clear action. Even at 1.2⁰C, we have seen the increasing impacts of climate change every day, but without an adequate global response to address them. The Paris Agreement enshrines a warming limit which is publicly accepted. But we also set ourselves the task of defining a **Global Goal on Adaptation** (GGA:글로벌 적응목표).

We need the G20 to ensure that the human face of the climate crisis is at the center of all its decision making. This includes a GGA Framework that elaborates the vision for a landing zone for global resilience, as well as the means to assess progress towards this landing zone, while pinpointing the necessary adaptation action globally, and what strengthened adaptation finance must support, including the urgent commitment to double adaptation finance.

As the IPCC has set out, some of the impacts of climate change go beyond viable adaptation. It is absolutely clear that COP28 must deliver on the promises on loss and damage made in Sharm-El- Sheikh. The G20 must affirm its commitment to achieve the operationalization of the fund and funding arrangements. Those at the frontline of climate change need our support now, not in 5 years’ time. This is the benchmark for ambition.

Whether we can deliver on a truly ambitious agenda that fills the gaps to 2030 will depend on our ability to make climate finance available, affordable and accessible to developing countries. Climate finance arrangements will need to be transformed to deliver at the necessary scale, to work better as a system and to support private finance mobilization at unprecedented levels. Commitments made must be delivered upon, including on the $100 billion, adaptation finance doubling and the forthcoming Green Climate Fund replenishment. G20 countries must also demonstrate leadership in actively aligning financial flows to the Paris Agreement through the multilateral development banks and other avenues.

We must leave Chennai on the right path and with a clear signal that the political will to tackle the climate crisis is there. Every meeting counts, every outcome must bring us closer. COP28 will bring countries together to deliver the way forward on climate action, commitments on mitigation, and adaptation and finance will need to be revised, to be in line with delivering on the Paris Agreement. The world needs its leaders to unite, act and deliver; and that must start with the G20.

**Joint Meeting of the 137th Session of the Program Committee and the 198th Session of the Finance Committee By FAO Director-General, 6 November 2023**

Members of the Programme and Finance Committees, Dear Colleagues, Good morning. I wish to start by expressing my heartfelt sadness at the loss of lives in the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, Sudan, Ukraine, and in other protracted crises around the world. Peace is a prerequisite for food security, and the Right to Food is a basic human right. FAO continues to assist the most vulnerable, globally, to meet their food security needs, in line with FAO’s mandate.

In the face of escalating global challenges: food availability, food accessibility and food affordability; the climate crisis; biodiversity loss; economic downturns; worsening poverty; and other overlapping challenges, we find ourselves standing at a critical juncture. There is increased international consensus that transforming agrifood systems to increase their efficiency, inclusiveness, resilience, and sustainability is essential to a comprehensive design for realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

This year’s State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) report sets out the real impacts, both positive and negative, of global agrifood systems for informed decision-making in support of the SDGs, and of FAO's vision to transform agrifood systems for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind. Similarly, this year we launch our new flagship on the Impact of Disasters on Agriculture and Food Security 2023, which provides a timely and comprehensive overview of how disasters are affecting agriculture and food security around the world.

FAO continues to be a global leader and point of reference in providing timely and professional information on global agrifood systems. Examples include the monthly FAO Food Price Index, Cereals Supply and Demand Brief among others. The FAO Food Price Index averaged 120.6 points in October 2023, down 0.7 points (0.5%) from September, continuing the downward trend since June and standing 14.8 points (10.9%) below its corresponding value a year ago. This shows that food availability is improving, but a total of 46 countries around the world still need external assistance for food, according to the latest FAO Crop Prospects and Food Situation report.

These reports are complemented with FAO’s policy briefs, information notes, and the hunger hotspots report on the impacts of ongoing conflicts and other challenges on global food security, which provide early warning and facilitate anticipatory action to the benefit of the most vulnerable populations.

Dear Colleagues, Since the FAO Ministerial Conference in July, FAO has hosted several key international events and participated in a number of multilateral meetings, as it continues to be a world player on the international related agenda.

On 10 July, addressing a high-level United Nations Townhall Meeting held in New York during the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) 2023 on Sustainable Development, under the theme "Overcoming the crises, driving transformation for the SDGs, and leaving no one behind,” I outlined six actions needed to transform agrifood systems ahead of the 2023 SDG Summit in September. 24 Heads of State and more than 120 ministerial participants in person came to FAO in late July, built momentum for implementation of national food system transformation pathways and brought together all partners to report on progress and commit to address bottlenecks through bolder action.

From 29 July to 2 August, I had initiated a joint visit to South Sudan, together with the President of IFAD and the Executive Director of WFP. The visit highlighted our joint work and solidarity to support South Sudan moving from a humanitarian approach to a focus on development. We also signed a new and much stronger MOU to guide our important work together. In the first week of September, I travelled to Samarkand to participate in the International Conference on Food Security, organized by the Government of Uzbekistan with technical support from FAO. More than twenty ministerial delegates from Asia, Africa, Europe, and others, attended.

I also participated in the First Uzbekistan Agrifood Investment Forum where world leaders discussed concrete actions to create an enabling environment for unlocking both public and private investments and repurposing agricultural subsidies to meet the USD 4 trillion cost for transforming agrifood systems by the deadline of 2030. After Samarkand, I travelled to Brazil where I had several intensive discussions with relevant ministers and signed a Letter of Intent with the Brazilian Government to establish a Center for Trilateral South-South Cooperation in Brazil.

From Brazil I went to Cuba where I attended the “G77 + China” Summit chaired by President of Cuba with over 60 Heads of State and the UNSG under the general debate “Current Development Challenges: The Role of Science, Technology and Innovation” for agrifood system transformation. In late September, FAO hosted two historical global conferences and a small exhibition as a good example of the coherence of the business model change. The first ever FAO Global Conference on Sustainable Livestock Transformation, which will lead to the establishment of the Sustainable Livestock Transformation Digital Platform and continue supporting Members through the Sustainable Livestock Transformation Initiative.

And, in the very same week, we hosted the first-ever Global Conference on Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization with an impressive exhibition that showcased the important role that mechanization plays to transform agrifood systems, and the Call-to-Action outcome document will concretely guide next steps as a global knowledge product.

In October, FAO convened the Global Symposium on Soils and Water, together with the 2nd Rome Water Dialogue. The meetings provided a global platform to exchange knowledge, practices and solutions underlying the need to invest in effective and inclusive governance, data, and technologies for integrated management of soil and water, especially after the UN Water Conference in late March. FAO will also continue supporting Members in developing their National Water Roadmaps, and progress is ongoing in the implementation of the Blue Transformation Initiative. FAO continues to support the integration of the aquatic food sector into national processes, as well as at the multilateral level.

**Sustainable growth for a resilient development, FAO Director-General 14/11/2024**

What would be the best policy options to improve our efforts to reduce food loss and waste in the Asia Pacific region? Except for a few hotspots, the Asia and the Pacific region has eradicated hunger with less than 1.7 percent of its population impacted by caloric deficiency. However, access to healthy diets remains insufficient, with 18.1 percent of the population that cannot afford healthy diets. At the same time, the hidden costs of agrifood systems represent 8.5 percent of GDP – with 80 percent of the hidden costs being health-related.

We urgently need to reduce food loss and waste to tackle current and future challenges, and to achieve the Four Betters. It will help deliver a better environment, by saving natural resources; better nutrition, by improving access to healthy, but perishable products; and a better life, by improving the income of food producers and life quality and then better food systems. The global value of food lost between harvest and retail amounted to USD 400 billion. Furthermore, 1.4 billion hectares of crop land and pasture area, and 250 cubic kilometers of water were used for growing food that is eventually lost and wasted.

These figures tend to be higher for fruits and vegetables, with global losses in fruits and vegetables amounting to about 30 percent, in contrast to 7 percent for cereals and pulses. To fix this problem, we need to take action to deliver better production all along the value chains, targeting specific hotspots of losses and using innovation and technology, and investment in value chain infrastructure, and introducing enabling policies to reduce them.

For instance, the highest level of food loss for fruits and vegetables takes place in the transportation phase in Central and South Asia, which can reach up to 25 percent, while in East and Southeast Asia, the rate of losses is the highest in the storage and processing stage (20 percent), and packaging stage (12 percent). To effectively target commodities and stages along the value chains requires investment in data collection, and FAO has developed tools to facilitate this data collection, and to scale up efforts.

The FAO Food Loss Index, and the FAO Food Loss App are examples of knowledge for action and targeted results. The Food Loss App will also make significant strides in enhancing FAO’s ability to analyze where and why food losses take place at the farm level by utilizing crowd-sourced information from farmers, and by supporting efforts by countries and partners towards achieving SDG.

How can we guarantee a just energy transition for economies and all sectors of societies at the same time? A Just transition is essential for sustainable growth and for resilient development. It is particularly important to address the issues of climate, energy and environmental transitions in the context of agrifood systems. Our agrifood systems need to be transformed to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable, to enable feeding a global population of almost 10 billion by 2050, while adapting to climate change and not exceeding the 1.5 degrees threshold of global warming.

This transformation must occur with the full recognition that decarbonization by mid-century is simply not possible without investing in agrifood systems and rural areas. In particular, on the use of energy that is needed at every stage of the agrifood system. Producing enough food for the world - from fields to food markets - comprises about 30% of all energy consumed, and over a third of greenhouse gas emissions from agrifood systems are the result of energy use.

Agrifood systems are vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, as we have witnessed in the past few years, while also being significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. We need to reverse this trend. A radical transformation in how food is produced, processed, traded and consumed is required, and this must happen by strengthening the role of agrifood systems as climate solutions.

Achieving climate ambition requires taking into consideration all sectors of society coherently, and a complete change of our energy systems. Due to the scale and magnitude of the changes needed, it is essential to think holistically to create synergies. Many solutions will be at the crossroads between different sectors: fragmented sectoral approaches simply will not work.

This is why FAO released a Global Roadmap at COP28, to Achieve SDG without breaching the 1.5-degrees Celsius threshold. We have integrated the roadmap of the International Energy Agency (IEA), and focused on solutions to make sure we can fulfill the global need for energy and food.

We also positioned the just transition at the center of the transformation of global agrifood systems – just as it should be central in the energy transition.

The APEC region is already moving fast towards the energy transition. The region has succeeded in rapidly scaling up green technologies. Initiatives, such as the APEC Electric Vehicles Roadmap, aim to harmonize standards and regulations, thereby facilitating the broader use of Electric Vehicles across various sectors, including agriculture. However, it is essential to consider the potential unintended consequences of developing some promising energy sources: acting fast is important, acting strategically is even more important!

Transformation is systemic in nature, and it is not only about producing more, but innovating the way we produce - to produce more with less. To achieve this, we need an integrated approach and international coordination. The Just Transition principle should be prioritized to make sure that no country, or individual is left behind, especially youth and women in the rural areas. In particular, in the APEC region, Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) make up 97 percent of the economy and are essential as they provide most of the employment and new jobs, and are major contributors to value creation.

Their contribution is even greater when informal businesses are taken into account, and we need to actively include them. They should be supported with the right tools, right technologies, right policy incentives, and while ensuring access to finance. It is essential to ensure incentives are aligned with climate ambition, and we need to invest in innovations to achieve improved productivity. Financial support to SMEs is essential in the transition to ensure they can uptake innovations. Innovations that should favour co-generation and knowledge-sharing approaches between relevant partners to ensure a just transition.

The Changing Landscape of Crypto Assets—Considerations for Regulatory and Supervisory Authorities IMF-FSB-OCC Crypto Conference February 23, 2024

Good morning and welcome to the IMF. It is my pleasure to be here with you today to open the third and final day of what has been a successful and productive week. My congratulations to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for hosting a fantastic event yesterday with a wonderful set of speakers, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for providing another important Crypto Working Group meeting the day before. Today, I’ll aim to highlight some of the main issues we observe in the face of greater use of crypto assets across the world, as well as provide you with an understanding of how the Fund seeks to help its member countries to implement the FSB Global Regulatory Framework for Crypto Asset Activities.

Crypto assets have implications for macroeconomic and financial stability that are mutually interactive and reinforcing. Therefore, a comprehensive policy and regulatory response is necessary to address the risks of crypto assets. At the IMF, a key part of our mandate is the safety and soundness of the international monetary system, as well as global macroeconomic and financial stability. While crypto markets do not currently pose a risk to financial stability in most jurisdictions, adoption of crypto assets tends to be higher in emerging markets and low-income jurisdictions.

Widespread adoption of crypto assets in these countries could undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy, circumvent capital flow management measures, exacerbate fiscal risks, and divert resources from financing the real economy. We must remain vigilant to the growth of crypto asset markets, and their interlinkages with incumbent financial institutions. The rapid growth of stable coins denominated in foreign currencies in many emerging economies requires a careful understanding of risks. For example, many emerging economies lack effective legal and regulatory oversight. These economies also lack legal provisions for “bankruptcy remoteness,” meaning reserve assets can be commingled and not be secured if the issuer or its affiliates fail. This creates a situation where reserve assets tend to be managed by custodians located in advanced economies.

Therefore, a shift from foreign exchange deposits to foreign exchange denominated stable coins often creates capital outflows from the local banks in emerging economies to the reserve assets managed by the custodian in advanced economies. Such outflows could potentially trigger higher volatility of the local currency and exert pressure on macroeconomic growth. Regulation and supervision of crypto asset issuers and service providers doesn’t directly solve the macroeconomic and financial stability issues. Yet, the establishment and effective implementation of regulation and supervision is an important foundation for better data collection, effective capital flow measures, and fiscal and tax policies.

Therefore, the IMF is very pleased to deepen cooperation with the FSB, as well as with other standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities around the world. We’ve done a lot of work in the space of crypto and macroeconomic stability. In October 2021, we shared our emerging thoughts on the impact of crypto on macroeconomic stability through the Global Financial Stability Report. It was here that we first explored the concept of “cryptoization,” referring to how widespread and rapid adoption of crypto assets could reinforce dollarization forces in the economy.

Almost exactly a year ago, we published a policy paper endorsed by our Executive Board on the elements for effective crypto policies, as well as our note to the G20 on the macrofinancial implications of crypto assets. In this note to the G20, we shared our analysis that the widespread proliferation of crypto assets comes with substantial risks to the effectiveness of monetary policy, exchange rate management, and capital flow management measures, as well as to fiscal sustainability. Moreover, expanded use of crypto assets also requires changes to central bank reserve holdings and the global financial safety net, resulting in potential further instability.

In September 2023, we worked seamlessly with the FSB secretariat to produce the IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper: Policies for Crypto-Assets. The paper describes how the policy and regulatory frameworks by the IMF and the FSB (alongside standard-setting bodies) fit together and interact with each other. While activities in crypto markets often mirror those in traditional financial services, they are typically delivered in a novel way using distributed ledgers. This can be challenging from a regulatory and supervisory perspective, particularly for resource-constrained authorities.

To understand the challenges, we need to look a little more closely at the layers of technology used to support distributed ledgers. The deeper layers of distributed ledger technology, such as the network and consensus layers, help ensure that there is a single, sequenced, standardized, and cryptographically-secured record of activity. However, it is not practical for regulators to have technical expertise in building and maintaining blockchain networks. Yet at the same time, understanding the fundamentals and the trade-offs of different consensus mechanisms is important.

Accessing and monitoring pseudonymous blockchain data is challenging for non-experts. In many emerging economies, there is a lack of available skills to build and maintain these tools. Some authorities partner with blockchain analytics firms to better monitor blockchain data. However, supervisors must understand the strengths and limitations of blockchain analytics tools. The uneven growth of crypto markets across the world means the challenges regulators face are different. At the same time, the capacity of regulators to monitor and respond to risks generated by crypto markets is also different.

The IMF has the unique privilege of a near universal membership composed of advanced, emerging, and low-income countries. Our teams work closely with authorities in our member countries across the world to understand how crypto might impact their financial markets and economies. We listen to their concerns and observations, identify risks, and analyze their capacity to respond to those risks. The information and data we gather from these interactions allows us to better understand growing trends and challenges. We use this information to help authorities to close data gaps, as well as assist them with prioritizing responses to the most critical issues among various competing tasks. And, with this collaborative approach, we were recently able to disseminate best practice before the implementation of global standards through our Fintech Notes on regulating crypto ecosystem and a supervisory primer on blockchain consensus mechanisms.

As global standards developed, including the FSB recommendations and standards and guidance from the standard-setting bodies, we began incorporating these into our surveillance in jurisdictions where crypto assets have the potential for systemic impact. For example, the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program, or “FSAP,” started pilot exercises in 2018 to cover fintech and crypto assets issues. Over the past several years, reviewing crypto regulation has been a part of our financial sector assessments for Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United States. Some of the assessments include a wider examination taking into account other financial technology components.

Last year, we conducted an FSAP on the regulation and supervision of crypto assets in Kazakhstan, our first standalone crypto workstream as part of an FSAP, reflecting the growing interest in crypto markets, particularly in emerging market economies. When crypto assets fall within the scope of these assessment programs due to their potential systemic impact in a specific jurisdiction, the implementation of corresponding recommendations will also be evaluated. At that point, the focus would be on highlighting any existing implementation gaps. The establishment of robust global standards, including the two FSB high level recommendations on regulation and supervision of crypto assets, will help us to guide our surveillance work more effectively and efficiently.

Moving onto capacity development, another core function of the IMF, there are several ways in which we can support our members to implement global standards and recommendations. One way is through our regional training programs. Together with our regional training and capacity development centers across the world, we deliver courses on fintech regulation, including a component on crypto regulation. Here we provide practical guidance on implementing the standards set by the FSB, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).

In fact, the FSB secretariat has delivered a session at each of our courses since the finalization of the high-level recommendations and we look forward to welcoming IOSCO officials to future fintech courses. Over the past 12 months we have reached over 250 individual supervisors from around 60 different regulatory authorities. The second way is through bilateral technical assistance. Over the past 12 months, we have provided assistance on crypto regulation to jurisdictions across Asia, Africa, and the Americas. This involves working closely with regulatory authorities in a country over a period spanning several months, engaging with industry, government departments and other relevant stakeholders, and offering recommendations to ensure crypto frameworks are implemented in a way that is consistent with global standards and recommendations.

With that, I would like to thank you for your participation as part of the conference this week and wish you a productive day. We have some fantastic speakers lined up today, and IMF experts will be on hand to speak with you throughout the day on the work we are doing in this space. In-person meetings of the Crypto Working Group are rare, but to have the knowledge and insight of this extended audience available to us in one place is rarer still. I encourage all of you to make the most of this opportunity and explore with your counterparts the experience, observations, and challenges that different authorities are facing across the globe.

**Remarks in Joint Press Conference following ROK-U.S. Summit**

President Biden, thank you for your special and warm hospitality. I am very pleased to be making a state visit to the United States during this meaningful year that marks the 70th anniversary of the ROK-U.S. Alliance. Our two countries have overcome challenges and crises during the past 70 years based on the deep roots of freedom and democracy, building a value alliance that is strong, resilient, and sustainable. We are now being threatened by an unprecedented polycrisis. The ROK-U.S. Alliance is jointly overcoming this crisis as a righteous alliance that contributes to world peace and prosperity.

We will further expand the depth and denotation of the ROK-U.S. global comprehensive strategic partnership and march forward to the future. Today, President Biden and myself engaged in constructive dialogue to discuss ways to materialize this shared vision. The outcome of our dialogue is well outlined in the joint statement adopted today. The first key outcome is extended deterrence. Sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula does not happen automatically. Our two leaders have decided to significantly strengthen extended deterrence of our two countries against North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats so that we can achieve peace through the superiority of overwhelming forces and not a false peace based on the goodwill of the other side.

Such a will and commitment is captured in the Washington Declaration. President Biden has reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to extended deterrence toward the Republic of Korea. Our two countries have agreed to immediate bilateral presidential consultations in the event of North Korea’s nuclear attack and promised to respond swiftly, overwhelmingly and decisively using the full force of the alliance including the United States’ nuclear weapons. Our two countries have agreed to establish a Nuclear Consultative Group to map out a specific plan to operate the new extended deterrence system.

Now our two countries will share information on nuclear and strategic weapon operations plans in response to North Korea’s threats and have regular consultations on ways to plan and execute joint operations that combine Korea’s state-of-the-art conventional forces with the U.S.’s nuclear capabilities, the results of which will be reported to the leaders of our two countries. In addition, our two countries have agreed to further advance tabletop exercises against a potential nuclear crisis. In addition, deployment of the United States’ strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula will be made constantly and routinely.

President Biden and I will continue to cooperate to strengthen extended deterrence between our two countries based on our historic and concrete agreement reached during our summit. Second, our two leaders have agreed to further strengthen the strategic partnership in economic security, which is directly related to the national economies of our two countries. President Biden and I welcomed the expansion of our firms’ bilateral mutual investment and advanced technology, including semiconductors, electric vehicles and batteries.

President Biden has said that no special support and considerations will be spared for Korean companies’ investment and business activities in particular. We have agreed to consult and coordinate closely so that the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act can further strengthen supply chain cooperation between the two countries in advanced technology. Furthermore, we plan on ramping up partnerships in cutting-edge technology. We have agreed to establish a dialogue for next-generation emerging and core technology between the U.S. National Security Council and the Korea Office of National Security, pertaining to chips, batteries, biotechnology, quantum science and other cutting-edge technologies, with the aim of promoting joint R&D and experts exchange.

We have also adopted a separate joint statement for strengthening cooperation in the rapidly emerging quantum science and technology domain. President Biden and I have also agreed to get the ball rolling on discussions about expanding our alliance into the cyber and space realms by applying the Mutual Defense Treaty in cyberspace and space as well. We have also agreed that the Strategic Cybersecurity Cooperation Framework adopted this time around will serve as the foundation on which we address cyber threats together and boost cooperation in information sharing, collection and analysis.

Space is another area that shows great promise for cooperation between our two countries. During my time here, I was able to visit the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) Goddard Space Center. President Biden welcomed the establishment of the Korea Aerospace Administration(KASA), and we have agreed to promote cooperation between KASA and NASA. We have also agreed to accelerate discussions on reaching a reciprocal defense procurement agreement, which is equivalent to an FTA in terms of national defense. Meanwhile, President Biden and I have agreed to promote exchange between the future generations of our two countries. To this end, we have launched the U.S.-ROK special exchange initiative for youths. In celebration of the 70th anniversary of the ROK-U.S. Alliance this year, our two countries plan to invest a total of $60 million to support exchanges between 2,023 youths majoring in STEM, humanities and social sciences.

And this also includes the largest Fulbright program to date, which will provide scholarships for 200 students. Last but not least, President Biden and I have agreed that Republic of Korea and the United States, as key partners in achieving stability and building peace in the Indo-Pacific region, will put our heads together as we implement our Indo-Pacific strategies to strengthen our cooperation in addressing regional and global challenges. In particular, President Biden expressed strong support for efforts made by the Korean government to normalize Korea-Japan relations, and we have agreed to continue our efforts in strengthening Korea-U.S.-Japan trilateral cooperation.

Furthermore, we reaffirmed that the use of force to take the lives of innocent people – an example of which would be Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – can in no circumstances whatsoever be justified. In that sense, we agreed to continue our cooperation and efforts alongside the international community to support Ukraine. During this meeting, we also discussed plans through which our two countries can take a leadership role in addressing global challenges, such as climate change, international development cooperation, and energy and food security.

I am delighted that through today’s meeting, we’ve opened up a new chapter for the next 70 years of the ROK-U.S. Alliance. We also reaffirmed our shared faith in and vision for a free society. I hope President Biden and I, with the support of the people of our two countries, can fully deliver on the blueprint for the “Alliance in Action toward the Future” that we have mapped out today.

Thank you.

**Speech to the Forum for the Future of Agriculture – Brussels, Belgium**

Thank you for the invitation to speak at today's forum in the great city of Brussels. What a fantastic opportunity to exchange ideas on the role agriculture plays in global sustainability. It was a pleasure to hear from the previous speaker, Kofi Annan, given the wealth his experience brings to the conversation. I also look forward to hearing from my fellow speakers in the panel discussion on this vital issue.

The Sustainable Development Goals have placed agriculture at the forefront of the global development agenda, and have helped bring an important focus on issues of food security and sustainable agriculture. The scale and speed of our rising global population is well-understood, however the ability of agricultural production and distribution to meet this demand is a challenge that we must all address.

For example, global population is forecast to grow by 2.3 billion by 2050. Global agriculture demand will need to increase by 60 to 70 per cent to meet this demand. Farmers worldwide are realising they will need to produce more safe and nutritious food while operating within increasingly tight environmental constraints.

Of course, the Sustainable Development Goals are all interrelated and cover a number of areas of importance to food production, however I want to draw on a specific few of these goals, and elaborate on how they relate to what we have experienced in New Zealand.

New Zealand has a population of around four and a half million people, and we can currently feed around 40 million people. We won’t be able to produce much more food, yet we’ve set a target to double the value of our primary sector exports by 2025. The defining moment in this ambition actually started in the 1980’s. Prior to then, New Zealand was very much the UK’s farm. The majority of our agricultural production was basic in nature, and predominately exported to one market.

After the UK joined the European Market we were forced to adapt. Almost overnight we moved from an inefficient Government-subsidised production system to the subsidy-free system we still have today, and are proud of. At the time, many thought this would be the end of farming in New Zealand. But farmers are innovative people. When required to, they can follow market signals.

These days, the signals farmers respond to come directly from consumers. In response, farmers have adapted, making higher quality products that people want to buy, responding to changing tastes and demand, while ensuring the safety and sustainability of their products. In order to find the most efficient way of improving on-farm performance, farmers need to be at the centre of innovation, and listening carefully to these desires of the consumer.

The Primary Growth Partnership in New Zealand is designed to help find new technologies and production systems that fix problems facing the industry. Farming groups put up their own money which is supported by Government to make them happen – and the challenges we’ve set ourselves demonstrate how much environmental and economic drivers are united:

We’re working for a 50% increase in the efficiency of nitrogen fertiliser, and a 20% increase in the efficiency of phosphates, reducing nutrient losses and preventing harm to waterways We’re using advanced monitoring and breeding techniques to produce sheep with a higher level of naturally present omega-3 fatty acids – meaning healthier sheep meat. We’re developing and promoting technologies that help farmers digitise information about their farming practise, track a number of indicators and ultimately share their best on farm techniques with others in a way that improves productivity.

We know all of these projects can help empower farmers to do what they do better, and in the process create more sustainable farming businesses. Today we live in an age where consumers are increasingly more aware of the products they consume. However, at the same time, they are also more detached from the processes that occur inside the farm gate.

We all have a role to narrow this urban/rural disconnect. Consumers need to know we are good stewards of our land and sea, and we need to understand that we require a social licence to operate. In my opinion, farmers and growers are naturally environmentalists. They want to leave the land in a better state than they found it – for their children and their grandchildren.

Similar to the aspiration of SDG 6, the New Zealand Government has recently set a target to improve the quality of our waterways. New Zealand is blessed with beautiful natural resources, however agriculture and urbanisation have had an impact.

Currently 72 percent of New Zealand rivers meet a ‘swimmable’ standard – meaning that you can swim without getting sick from bugs in the water. The Government has set a target of having 90 percent of rivers swimmable by 2040. This will involve farmers fencing off 56,000 kilometers of our waterways to exclude livestock and reduce levels of eColi. This distance is from New Zealand to Europe - not once but three times! This follows the great work dairy farmers have already voluntarily done over the last decade to exclude nearly all dairy cows from waterways.

As outlined in SDG 13, we also must take urgent action to tackle climate change. New Zealand is also keen to be a part of setting the global economy on a pathway to a low-emission future under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We realise our emissions profile is different to many other countries, with 50% of our emissions coming from animals, although we are only 0.15% of worldwide emissions.

That’s why we helped support the establishment of the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse gases which has seen 47 member countries join – including 15 from Europe. It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach with the work programme, including focuses on rice paddies, pastoral livestock and cropping. As a niche producer that makes its living in global markets, New Zealand experiences every day the obstacles in place for agricultural producers seeking to make a sustainable income from trading internationally. Developing countries face the same issues.

We need to move away from jealously guarding domestic markets, and consider how we can best work together to seize the far greater opportunities and challenges being generated by spiralling global demand. As mentioned in SDG 17, a sustainable global agricultural sector requires stable trade flows between countries, and the increased involvement of farmers, harvesters and processors in the global value chain.

Populations are growing, and food production must grow too – but this won’t necessarily happen in the same places. Food has to cross borders to get to growing population centres, and at the same time we need efficient global food markets to cushion the impacts of local environmental and climactic events like famines, floods, and other issues that lead to avoidable food price volatility, hunger and deprivation.

At the centre of the global food security equation is the multilateral trading system, underwritten by the World Trade Organisation. That institution still sets the rules that govern the flow of food around the world, as it has done for the last 23 years. Increasingly though, regional and bilateral trade agreements are forming – coalitions of countries who realise the importance of upgrading the rules of global commerce. New Zealand and Europe are key players in many of those coalitions, just as we are partners in helping to improve the WTO framework.

For example, many New Zealand companies are now cooperating throughout European countries with other producers. This involves complimenting one another on seasonality differences and different access to markets to benefit farmers in each country. These partnerships need to provide a firm basis for the enormous investments needed to sustainably lift agricultural production to meet demand in the coming decades.

There is a multitude of areas we should be focusing on to address the Sustainable Development Goals. However, one thing is certain, for anything to be successful, the farmer must be at the centre.

Thank you.
