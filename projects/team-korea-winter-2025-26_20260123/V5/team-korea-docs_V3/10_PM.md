**Team Korea Winter Dashboard 2025-26 (V3)**
**Project Management & Quality Assurance**

---

## 1. Role Definition: Project Director
In V3, the role shifts from "Manager" to **"Director"**. The Director does not just track tasks; they enforce a standard of excellence. The Director is the guardian of the "National Team Premium" identity.

**Core Responsibilities:**
-   **Gatekeeping**: No code or design is merged unless it meets the V3 aesthetic and technical standards.
-   **Synchronization**: Ensuring the Data Team and Design Team are perfectly aligned (e.g., Design doesn't request data that doesn't exist).
-   **Risk Management**: Identifying "cliché" traps and "data drift" early.

---

## 2. The "No-Cliché" Policy
The PM explicitly forbids the following patterns found in V1/V2:
1.  **Generic loaders**: Use custom, brand-aligned loading states.
2.  **Default shadows**: Use multi-layered, diffuse shadows or neon glows.
3.  **Skeleton screens**: Use sophisticated layout transitions instead.
4.  **"Cute" copy**: Tone must be serious, professional, and confident.

## 3. Workflow & Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
-   [x] Establish V3 Documentation.
-   [ ] Define strict Data Schema (Pydantic Models).
-   [ ] Set up Design System Tokens (Tailwind Config).

### Phase 2: Core Construction
-   [ ] Build "Hyper-Modern" Layout Shell (Navigation, Footer).
-   [ ] Implement Data Pipeline (Scraper -> Validator -> JSON).
-   [ ] Create "Hero" Dashboard Component.

### Phase 3: Polish & Expansion
-   [ ] Athlete Detail Pages (Editorial Layout).
-   [ ] Motion Tuning (Curve adjustment, staggering).
-   [ ] Final Deployment to Netlify.

## 4. Quality Assurance Protocol

### Visual QA (VQA)
Every screen must pass the **"Screenshot Test"**:
> "If you took a screenshot of any page, would it look like a high-end sports magazine spread?"
If the answer is "No" (looks like a generic admin dashboard), it is rejected.

### Data QA (DQA)
Every data update must pass the **"Integrity Check"**:
> "Does every Result link to a valid Athlete? Are there any duplicate Event IDs?"
Automated scripts will enforce this before any build.

## 5. Communication Channels
-   **Directives**: Top-down instructions on Design/Tech choices.
-   **Alerts**: Immediate notification of data schema generated errors.
-   **Reviews**: Staged reviews of UI components (Isolated Workbench).
