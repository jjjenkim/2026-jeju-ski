# PM SCOPE

## Target Users

## Core Problem
FIS regulations are scattered across multiple PDFs and hard to search quickly on mobile or under pressure.

## MVP Cut-lines
- **Included**: PDF ingestion from URLs, localized search, Q&A with evidence.
- **excluded**: User accounts, history saving, offline mode (for now).
