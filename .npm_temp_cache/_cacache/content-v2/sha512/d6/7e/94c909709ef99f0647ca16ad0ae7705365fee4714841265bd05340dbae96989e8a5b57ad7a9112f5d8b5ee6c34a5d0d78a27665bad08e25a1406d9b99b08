[Create a new Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)\n2. [Enable the Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/workspace-api/products)\n3. [Configure an OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) (\"internal\" is fine for testing)\n4. Add OAuth scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`\n5. [Create an OAuth Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) for application type \"Desktop App\"\n6. Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys\n7. Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json` and place into the root of this repo (i.e. `servers/gcp-oauth.keys.json`)\n\nMake sure to build the server with either `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.\n\n### Authentication\n\nTo authenticate and save credentials:\n\n1. Run the server with the `auth` argument: `node ./dist auth`\n2. This will open an authentication flow in your system browser\n3. Complete the authentication process\n4. Credentials will be saved in the root of this repo (i.e. `servers/.gdrive-server-credentials.json`)\n\n### Usage with Desktop App\n\nTo integrate this server with the desktop app, add the following to your app's server configuration:\n\n#### Docker\n\nAuthentication:\n\nAssuming you have completed setting up the OAuth application on Google Cloud, you can now auth the server with the following command, replacing `/path/to/gcp-oauth.keys.json` with the path to your OAuth keys file:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/gcp-oauth.keys.json,target=/gcp-oauth.keys.json -v mcp-gdrive:/gdrive-server -e GDRIVE_OAUTH_PATH=/gcp-oauth.keys.json -e \"GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/gdrive-server/credentials.json\" -p 3000:3000 mcp/gdrive auth\n```\n\nThe command will print the URL to open in your browser. Open this URL in your browser and complete the authentication process. The credentials will be saved in the `mcp-gdrive` volume.\n\nOnce authenticated, you can use the server in your app's server configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"gdrive\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\"run\", \"-i\", \"--rm\", \"-v\", \"mcp-gdrive:/gdrive-server\", \"-e\", \"GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/gdrive-server/credentials.json\", \"mcp/gdrive\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### NPX\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"gdrive\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-gdrive\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH\": \"/path/to/.gdrive-server-credentials.json\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage with VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons below..\n\n[![Install with NPX in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-NPM-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=gdrive&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22credentials_path%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Path%20to%20.gdrive-server-credentials.json%20file%22%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40modelcontextprotocol%2Fserver-gdrive%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Acredentials_path%7D%22%7D%7D) [![Install with NPX in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-NPM-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=gdrive&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22credentials_path%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Path%20to%20.gdrive-server-credentials.json%20file%22%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40modelcontextprotocol%2Fserver-gdrive%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Acredentials_path%7D%22%7D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Docker-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=gdrive&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-v%22%2C%22mcp-gdrive%3A%2Fgdrive-server%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH%3D%2Fgdrive-server%2Fcredentials.json%22%2C%22mcp%2Fgdrive%22%5D%7D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Docker-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=gdrive&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-v%22%2C%22mcp-gdrive%3A%2Fgdrive-server%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH%3D%2Fgdrive-server%2Fcredentials.json%22%2C%22mcp%2Fgdrive%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\nFor manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.\n\nOptionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.\n\n> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.\n\n#### NPX\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"gdrive\": {\n        \"command\": \"npx\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"-y\",\n          \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-gdrive\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH\": \"/path/to/.gdrive-server-credentials.json\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Docker\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"gdrive\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-v\",\n          \"mcp-gdrive:/gdrive-server\",\n          \"-e\",\n          \"GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/gdrive-server/credentials.json\",\n          \"mcp/gdrive\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License.
